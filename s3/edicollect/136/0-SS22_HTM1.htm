<p align="center"><strong><big><big><big><big><u>Medicaid Buy-In PART II: <br>
</u></big></big></big>Using Examples to Illustrate Key Eligibility Issues<br>
</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hundreds of readers responded to our Summer
2003 newsletter on the new Medicaid Buy-In program. This unprecedented response on our
toll-free hotline, through hits to our web sites, and turnouts at our training programs
suggested the need for another look at this important topic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of this article is to better
illustrate, through a series of examples, who is eligible and how they become eligible for
the Buy-In program. Our examples will illustrate the need to consider each of the key
eligibility concepts that we briefly summarize in the next section. Readers should keep in
mind that the article uses income eligibility levels that are based on the federal poverty
levels established for 2003. As we move into 2004, we can expect those levels to increase
slightly but the basic principles illustrated through the examples should still be valid.
However, since this program is still very new, some of the rules governing the Buy-In will
be clarified over time as the state publishes additional regulations and policies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our last newsletter, we explained that
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients are automatically eligible for Medicaid and
can retain Medicaid, when they lose SSI because of increased income from working, under
the 1619(b) program. We also noted that individuals with disabilities who do not qualify
for SSI or the 1619(b) program traditionally seek Medicaid through the medically needy or
spend down program. The spend down program requires some individuals to devote $500 or
more per month to meeting their share of Medicaid costs (i.e., their spend down
requirement). In fact, when monthly earnings over $800 (or $810 in 2004) are sustained the
individual loses the right to participate in the spend down program because they are no
longer considered disabled. Historically, this has meant that individuals who receive
Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) only without an SSI supplement, faced the
dubious choice of either working for substantial wages and losing Medicaid or keeping
their wages below $800 to retain Medicaid. Those individuals make the classic candidates
for the Buy-In program. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>A SUMMARY OF BUY-IN ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA </strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>The Basic Eligibility Group </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All initial applications for the Buy-In will
involve persons seeking Medicaid through this category. Six key concepts govern
eligibility:</p>

<p><strong>Disability:</strong> Must have a disability as defined for the SSI and SSDI
programs.</p>

<p><strong>Age:</strong> Must be between the ages of 16 and 64.</p>

<p><strong>Paid work:</strong> Must be working part-time or full-time and paying
&#147;applicable taxes.&#148; Even one hour of paid work per month will meet this
requirement. Employees meet this requirement if income taxes or FICA (Social Security and
Medicare taxes) are withheld from the paycheck. Self-employed individuals meet this
requirement if they are paying income taxes or FICA.</p>

<p><strong>No substantial gainful activity rule</strong>: An individual can earn more than
$800 per month in 2003 and still be eligible.</p>

<p><strong>Monthly income test:</strong> Must have countable income (i.e., after Medicaid
deductions) of $1,871 or less in 2003, i.e., 250 percent of the federal poverty level
(FPL). If monthly countable income is $1,123 or less, i.e., 150 percent of the FPL, no
premiums will be due.</p>

<p><strong>Resource limits:</strong> Must have countable resources of $10,000 or less. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>The Medical Improvement Group </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since eligibility under this category will
be limited to individuals who first are eligible under the Basic Eligibility Group, we
should see only a few of these cases during the first year of the Buy-In program. Over
time, we expect that some SSDI beneficiaries who are found to have medically improved,
following a continuing disability review, will be able to retain Buy-In coverage under
this category. Three key concepts govern eligibility:</p>

<p><strong>First eligible under Basic Coverage Group: </strong>Must be member of the Basic
Coverage Group who loses eligibility due to medical improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Continuing &#147;severe&#148; impairment:</strong> Must still have a
&#147;severe medically determinable impairment.&#148;</p>

<p><strong>At least 40 hours of work per month:</strong> Must work at least 40 hours per
month and earn the federal minimum wage or above. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATING BUY-IN ELIGIBILITY RULES </strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Disability </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Individual who receives SSDI.</strong>
This individual will meet the federal standard of disability which is the same for SSI and
SSDI.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Sixteen year old receives Social
Security survivor&#146;s benefits</strong>. These benefits are not based on disability.
Although a 16 year old will meet the age requirements, a disability determination will be
required by Medicaid.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Receipt of continued Medicare after
losing SSDI cash benefits because of work activity.</strong> Jerry was eligible for $700
in monthly SSDI benefits with no SSI supplement. One year ago ago he lost his SSDI
benefits because he worked and earned $1,200 per month after his nine-month trial work
period. Under the extended Medicare provisions, since Jerry is still medically disabled
his Medicare coverage continues even though his monthly wages are now up to $1,400 per
month. His continuing eligibility for Medicare, under this special work incentive, means
that he still meets the SSDI standard of disability. If he gets a letter from the Social
Security Administration (SSA) confirming this, he should be found disabled by the Buy-In
program on that basis alone. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>Age </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>No eligibility after age 65</strong>.
Loraine is 63 and receives $945 in SSDI. She works one day per week doing light
housekeeping despite a severe seizure disorder. She recently qualified for the Buy-In.
Under existing criteria, she will no longer be eligible for the Buy-In when she turns 65
and will face a Medicaid spend down of $300 or more per month if she is single. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>Paid Work Requirement </strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part-time tutor</strong>. Darius is
a college student with cerebral palsy who gets $786 in SSDI benefits on the earnings
record of his deceased mother. He works two hours per week in the college tutoring center,
tutoring other students in math. He earns $6 per hour and the only payroll deduction is
under the FICA category (Social Security and Medicare taxes), as he is not expected to owe
any state or federal income taxes at the end of the year. Since his employer is
withholding money for &#147;applicable taxes,&#148; Darius meets the &#147;paid work&#148;
requirements and will be eligible for the Buy-In if he meets other criteria.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; Bus pass and cash stipend to cover meals.</strong>
Joanne, who has a mental illness and receives $1,110 in SSDI, works 12 hours per week
doing filing through a hospital internship program. During the six-month program, she will
receive a bus pass and $100 per month toward lunch expenses. No deductions for taxes or
FICA are taken from the checks. Joanne will <u>not</u> meet the paid work requirements for
the Buy-In, as she gets an expense stipend and no taxes are withheld. She will face a
large spend down if she wants to obtain Medicaid. NOTE: If the hospital hires Joanne for
even one four-hour shift per month, with taxes or FICA withheld from her pay, she would
meet the paid work requirements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Work as an independent contractor</strong>.
Barry has severe arthritis and receives $400 per month from a private disability pension
and $450 from SSDI. He works 30 hours per month as an independent contractor for a home
health agency, earning $10 per hour to make home visits to review care plans of patients.
The agency does not deduct anything from the check he gets and Barry files quarterly
&#147;estimated tax payments&#148; with the Internal Revenue Service. Last year, all his
income tax payments were returned to him as a refund and he expects the same will happen
this year. He does not get any refund of the FICA taxes. Barry is paying &#147;applicable
taxes&#148; and will meet the paid work requirements of the Buy-In program. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>No Substantial Gainful Activity Test </strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loss of SSDI because of earnings.</strong>
Diana, age 43 and single, has multiple sclerosis and uses Medicaid to pay for medication
that would cost $1,000 per month if she paid for it. She receives SSDI benefits of $830
per month and must pay a spend down of more than $150 to obtain Medicaid. She graduates
from a community college with a degree in human services and obtains a job at a day
treatment program, serving adults with mental disabilities. She will earn $1,300 per month
in gross wages and will eventually lose her SSDI benefits because she is performing
substantial gainful activity (i.e., earning more than $800 gross monthly in 2003). Diana
should be eligible for the Buy-In despite earnings that are well above the substantial
gainful activity figure. So long as she meets the other Buy-In criteria, earnings above
the substantial gainful activity level are not relevant. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>The Monthly Income Test, Premium Payments </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; The income test.</strong> To be eligible
for the Buy-In, countable income can be no more than 250 percent of the the federal
poverty level (FPL). If countable income is more than 250 percent of FPL, the individual
will not be eligible for the Buy-In even if income is only slightly above the limit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following are the most common monthly
deductions from unearned and earned income. Unearned income: $20 general income exclusion.
Earned income: $65 plus any unused part of the $20 exclusion; impairment related work
expenses (IRWEs); an additional 50 percent of earned income; blind work expenses; and any
money set aside in an approved Plan for Achieving Self Support (PASS).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Criteria for monthly premiums. </strong>If
countable income is less than 150 percent of FPL, no premiums will be due. If countable
income is between 150 and 250 percent of FPL, premiums will be equal to 3 percent of
countable earned income and 7.5 percent of countable unearned income. Premiums will be
collected starting some time in 2004. </p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example 1.</strong> John is 33, has
a mental illness, and attends college. He is single, receives $862 in SSDI benefits, and
must pay a $200 spend down to qualify for Medicaid. Currently, John is not eligible for
the Buy-In because he is not working.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John accepts a job and will earn $265 gross
for working about 40 hours per month. Through payroll deductions, he is paying
&#147;applicable taxes.&#148; Under the spend down program, John will see his spend down
increase by $100 to $300 per month. However, if John applies for the Buy-In, now that he
meets the work requirement, he should be eligible with no premium payment due.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is how John&#146;s countable income is
determined: </p>

<p>Step 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unearned income

<p>Step 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counted unearned income
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

$ 942.00 </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since $942 is below the 2003 monthly figure
for 250 percent of FPL, i.e., $1871, he will be eligible for the Buy-In if he meets all
other criteria. Since countable income is also below 150 percent of FPL, i.e., $1123 per
month in 2003, he will not face a monthly premium even when premiums become a part of the
program. John will save $300 per month that he would have owed under the spend down
program. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Example 2. </strong>Lorena is
single, is profoundly deaf, receives $1,100 monthly in SSDI benefits, and earns $1,900
gross monthly (she is in a trial work period). She does not have a PASS plan or IRWEs and
does not qualify for any other income disregard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is how Lorena&#146;s countable income
is determined: </p>

<p>Step 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unearned income
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

$1,997.50 </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since $1,997.50 is more than the 2003
monthly figure for 250 percent of FPL, i.e., $1871, Lorena will be ineligible for the
Buy-In. Since the 2004 FPL figure will probably not go up by more than $50, she will
probably be ineligible in 2004 as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any suggestion we can make about
present or future eligibility for the Buy-In? Assuming her income remains the same, Lorena
could reduce her countable income below the $1,871 figure by using IRWEs or expenses from
an approved PASS. For example, if Lorena uses a PASS to save $300 per month toward the
purchase of a suitable vehicle to travel to her job, that would reduce her countable
income from $1,997.50 to $1,697.50 per month, putting her below the $1,871 figure. She
would then be financially eligible for the Buy-In.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What if reductions to income from IRWEs or a
PASS are not available? Based on the facts, we can anticipate Lorena&#146;s loss of SSDI
benefits if she keeps earning this much money after a nine-month trial work period. For
example, if she works for the first time as an SSDI recipient in January 2003 and works
every month, earning $1,900 gross throughout 2003, her last month of SSDI eligibility
would be December 2003. (She is eligible for continued SSDI benefits for nine trial work
months and a three-month grace period. See the Summer 2001 issue of the Benefits Planner,
available on the Neighborhood Legal Services website at www.nls.org/planner/summer01.htm
or .pdf.) Effective January 2004, she would no longer be eligible for SSDI and her
countable income would now be $917.50 per month from wages, well below the $1,871 figure
representing 250 percent of FPL in 2003. Since this is also below the $1,123 figure for
150 percent of FPL in 2003 (expected to be slightly higher in 2004), Lorena will now be
eligible for the Buy-In without a premium. </p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example 3.</strong> Eddie is single,
earns $2,790 gross per month, but does not receive either SSI or SSDI benefits. He
continues to have disabling arthritis, but lost his $850 in SSDI benefits in early 2003
following a trial work period and three-month grace period. He continues to get extended
Medicare benefits based on his continuing disability, but Medicare will not cover the cost
of his medications. Is he eligible for the Buy-In and, if so, must he pay a premium to
obtain Medicaid? </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is how Eddie&#146;s monthly countable
income is determined: </p>

<p>Step 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unearned income

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since $1,352.50 is below the 2003 monthly
figure for 250 percent of FPL, i.e., $1871, he will be eligible for the Buy-In if he meets
all other criteria. However, since countable monthly income is more than 150 percent of
FPL, i.e., $1123 per month in 2003, he will face a monthly premium when premiums become a
part of the program. At that time, his monthly premium is estimated to be $40.58, i.e., 3
percent of countable monthly earned income ($1,352.50 x .03).</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Filing a Buy-In Application: Strategy Tips</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the State Department of
Health&#146;s extensive training program, statewide, for Medicaid agency staff, we have
heard numerous reports of individuals who have faced difficulties when they applied for
the Medicaid Buy-In. While we have no way of knowing how common these problems have been,
the following appear to be common responses from Medicaid agency staff to attempts to
apply for the Buy-In as reported to us from several regions of the state: 

<ul>
  <li>&#147;There is no such program.&#148;</li>
  <li>&#147;Oh, the Buy-In, you mean the &#145;Medicaid spend down program.&#146; Our nickname
    for that program is the Buy-In.&#148;</li>
  <li>&#147;Oh, the Buy-In, you mean the &#145;Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB)
    program,&#146; through which the Medicaid agency will pay for an individual&#146;s
    Medicare Part B premiums. Our nickname for that program is the Buy-In.&#148;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the last two responses were
probably predictable, since both the spend down and QMB programs have often been referred
to as buy-in programs, since either the individual (in the case of spend down) or the
Medicaid agency (in the case of QMB) are buying in to a program by paying a monthly dollar
amount. Individuals with disabilities and their advocates will have to be vigilant to make
sure Medicaid staff understands that the individual wants to apply for the Medicaid Buy-In
and not either of the other two programs. We are hopeful that the first response, that the
program does not exist, will become much less common over time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some strategy tips to ensure that a
Buy-In application will be taken and treated appropriately: 

<ul>
  <li>At the top of the application (i.e., the same application used for all Medicaid and
    public assistance programs), write in a bold script: MEDICAID BUY-IN APPLICATION FOR
    PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. Some advocates suggest using a highlighter to make this stand
    out even more.</li>
  <li>Give the Medicaid agency worker documentation that explains the Buy-In program. Some
    advocates have told us they have submitted both a copy of our newsletter and a copy of the
    State Department of Health&#146;s policy on the Buy-In, Administrative Directive (ADM)
    03-04.<br>
    For copies of any of these documents or the Medicaid Buy-In &#147;At-a-Glance&#148; sheet
    that we have prepared and regularly update, call our toll-free technical assistance line
    at 1-888-224-3272. Please let us know of problems or success stories so we can report on
    these in subsequent issues of The Benefits Planner.</li>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Your previous newsletter did not explain how the Medicaid
Buy-In would work for an individual who is married. I am 53 years old, am disabled by a
back problem, and receive $853 in SSDI benefits. I live with my wife who earns $18,000
gross per year and a 12-year-old stepson who is not disabled and does not have any income
of his own. I am about to start a part-time job, working at the reception desk of a local
health club six hours per week and will earn approximately $200 gross per month. If I am
able to do this work, I hope to increase my hours over time. Will I face a spend down if I
apply for Medicaid? Will I be eligible for the Buy-In? </p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Your Medicaid agency will calculate your countable income
under both the spend down and Buy-In programs using the same formula. Since your wife is
working, it will use this formula to see if any of her income is &#147;deemed&#148;
available to you. Here is how it would work:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ 853.00<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
$ 1,404.50 </p>

<p>Since $1,404.50 is more than $292, we use the Medicaid couple rate of $934 and subtract
it from the countable income, leaving a spend down of $470.50. When you go to work and
earn $200 gross per month, your countable income would go up by $100 and your spend down
would increase to $570.50. </p>

<p>If you apply for the Buy-In after you start work, your countable income will be
$1,504.50. Since this is less than 250 percent of the FPL, i.e., $1,871 in 2003, you will
be eligible for the Buy-In. since this is more than 150 percent of this FPL, i.e., $1,123
in 2003, you will owe a premium when the State starts charging premiums some time in 2004.
Your premium is estimated to be $45.14 per month (.03 x $1,504.50). </p>

<p><strong>WHO IS COVERED?</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Basic Coverage Group: Workers over the age of 16 and under age of 65 who meet the SSI
    definition of disability</li>
  <li>Medical Improvement Group: Workers with a &#147;severe medically determinable
    impairment&#148; who were disabled and would otherwise lose basic group coverage due to
    &#147;medical improvement&#148;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BASIC COVERAGE GROUP: WHO IS ELIGIBLE?</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Have a disability as defined by the Social Security Administration</li>
  <li>Be at least 16 but not yet 65 years of age</li>
  <li>Be engaged in paid work (includes part-time and full-time work)</li>
  <li>There is no substantial gainful activity rule (i.e., an individual can earn more than
    $800 per month in 2003 and still be eligible for the buy-in)</li>
  <li>Have a gross income that may be as high as $46,170 for an individual and $61,870 for a
    couple (as of January 1, 2003)</li>
  <li>Have non-exempt resources that do not exceed $10,000</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT GROUP: WHO IS ELIGIBLE?</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Members of the Basic Coverage Group who lose Buy-In coverage due to medical improvement</li>
  <li>Must still have a &#147;severe medically determinable impairment&#148;</li>
  <li>Be engaged in paid work (40 hours per month and earn federally minimum wage)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>GRACE PERIODS OR WHAT IF I LOSE MY JOB?</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Change in Medical Condition: A grace period of up to six months will be allowed if, for
    medical reasons, the Medicaid Buy-In recipient is unable to continue working. Medical
    verification will be required.</li>
  <li>Job Loss (through no fault of recipient): A grace period of up to six months will be
    allowed if, through no fault of the recipient, job loss occurs (layoff, etc.).
    Verification will be required that the recipient is reasonably expected to return to work
    as it is a temporary layoff, or that the recipient is actively seeking new employment</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>INCOME LIMITS</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Individuals with countable income up to 250% of federal poverty levels (FPL)(i.e., gross
    wages as high as $46,170 in a household of 1, and $61,870 in a household of 2 for the year
    2003)</li>
  <li>Monthly countable income must be $1,871 or less in 2003 (i.e., up to 250% of FPL). If
    monthly countable income is $1,123 or less in 2003 (i.e., up to 150% of FPL), no premiums
    will be due.</li>
  <li>Individuals with income above 250% of FPL may not purchase Medicaid coverage.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DETERMINING COUNTABLE INCOME</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Will follow the same rules as used in the regular Medicaid spend down program.</li>
  <li>Typical deductions from income: first $20 of unearned income excluded; first $65, plus
    50% of remaining earned income excluded; impairment related work expenses is a deduction
    from earned income; money set aside in an approved Plan for Achieving Self Support (PASS)
    can be excluded from unearned or earned income.</li>
  <li>Example: An individual has $3,685 in gross monthly wages and no other income. This
    individual will have $1,800 in countable monthly income ($3,685 &#150; 20 &#150; 65 =
    3,600 &#150; 1,800 = $1,800). Since this is less than 250 % of the FPL for 2003, this
    individual will be eligible for the buy-in.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ASSET LIMITS</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>$10,000 is allowed in countable resources (i.e., bank accounts and other liquid
    resources)</li>
  <li>Exempt resources include: a house, a vehicle, certain life insurance policies, a limited
    burial reserve, and several other items</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PREMIUMS</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>A moratorium exists on premium collection until the Department of Social Services
    completes the automated payment system currently estimated as the spring of 2004</li>
  <li>Premiums range from $0 to $674 yearly (assuming all income is earned) in a household of
    1</li>
  <li>Premiums apply to all net income<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below 150% of FPL &#150; NO PREMIUM<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150% - 250% of FPL &#150; Premium
    of 3% of net earned income and 7.5% of net unearned income.</li>
  <li>Thus, a single individual with a disability could return to work and earn $46,170
    annually by paying a Medicaid premium of less than $60 per month (at the top level)</li>
  <li>Example: Using the example above, with $3,685 in gross monthly income and $1,800 in
    countable income, the individual&#146;s monthly buy-in premium would be $54 (i.e., .03 x
    $1,800).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>APPLYING FOR THE MEDICAID BUY-IN PROGRAM</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Application for the Medicaid Buy-In Program for Working People with Disabilities must be
    made at the Local Department of Social Services or the Human Resources Agency in New York
    City.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CASE PROCESSING</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>As the program began on July 1, 2003, State Department of Health Administrative
    Directive (ADM) 03-04 (June 9, 2003) had been issued to govern case processing in counties
    outside of New York City</li>
  <li>New York City will have its own case processing instructions for the Medicaid Buy-In
    program in a policy to be issued</li>
