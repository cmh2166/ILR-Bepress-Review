</u><big>SSI Eligibility for Teenagers and Young Adults With Disabilities<br>
Using SSI's Work Incentives in the Transition From School to Work</big></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The youth of America represent
our future. This includes children and young adults with severe disabilities whose
potential has long been unrealized. Many young people with disabilities will only realize
their dreams of self-support if they receive extra supports along the way: specialized
education or training; work or study aids, including assistive technology; cash benefits,
at least during a transition period; and adequate health insurance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fields of special
education and vocational rehabilitation, the term &quot;transition&quot; describes the
movement of youth with disabilities into adult life. Used broadly, the term captures not
only the movement from school to work, but also the movement to all the things we
associate with adult life, including independent living and the ability to enjoy the
social and recreational opportunities that life has to offer. &quot;Transition
planning&quot; describes the process of helping the student and family identify the
services and supports that will be needed to go through this transition process. Under the
special education laws, transition planning is expected to begin as early as age 14 and a
written &quot;transition plan&quot; should be in place by age 16. The transition period
can extend through the early to mid 20s, even though the role of special education
programs will end no later than age 21. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This article will focus on the
transition from school to work and the role that Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and
Medicaid will play during the transition years. Our premise is that no transition plan is
complete, for a student with a severe disability, without some consideration of SSI and
Medicaid. For a smaller number of students, transition planning must also consider the
role of Social Security dependents' and survivors' benefits, Social Security Disability
Insurance (SSDI), and Medicare. In all cases in which SSI, SSDI, Medicaid or Medicare
eligibility is expected, transition planning must consider the special work incentives
that may keep cash benefits and health insurance in place and even help to fund some
educational and vocational services.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this article is only an
overview, readers may want to review additional resources that we reference in the box
below.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><big><strong>SSI, Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare</strong></big></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Supplemental Security Income
(SSI)</strong> is a cash benefit program for the aged, blind, and disabled. It is
administered through the Social Security Administration (SSA). Young people can receive
SSI payments if they meet both a disability and financial needs test. If the young person
meets this criteria and lives with a parent or parents, the monthly SSI check in 2003 in
New York will be $575 (federal benefit rate of $552 and a state living with others
supplement of $23). If the individual has other countable income, he or she may get SSI at
a reduced amount.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Medicaid</strong>, sometimes
called Medical Assistance, is a health insurance program administered through the County
Departments of Social Services or the Human Resources Agency in New York City. If a child
or adult receives a monthly SSI check, even as little as $1, Medicaid eligibility is
automatic. Medicaid will pay for doctor visits, hospitalizations, therapies (physical,
occupational, speech), home health aides, a home nurse, an intermediate care facility,
prescription drugs, transportation, day treatment programs, durable medical equipment
(such as wheelchairs, augmentative communication equipment), and other items which are
medically necessary.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Social Security
benefits</strong> are available to some children if they are dependents of a parent who
paid into the Social Security trust fund and is now retired, disabled, or deceased. These
benefits are based on dependency, not disability, and will continue until a child
graduates from high school or turns age 19, whichever occurs first. <strong>SSDI benefits</strong>
are available, as early as age 18, to dependents of a parent who is retired, disabled, or
deceased. These benefits are often referred to as Disabled Adult Child's (DAC) benefits.
To receive DAC benefits, the individual must have a disability that began before age 22.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An individual can receive both
SSDI and SSI. For example, Janice, age 19, lives with her parents and receives $420 in
SSDI/DAC benefits. The SSI program will disregard the first $20 of her SSDI benefits ($420
- 400 = $400). It will then pay her a monthly SSI check of $175 ($575 - 400) and she will
qualify for Medicaid automatically.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Medicare</strong> is
typically associated with receipt of Social Security. An SSDI beneficiary will qualify for
Medicare after 24 months of eligibility. Medicare Part A, covering many inpatient
services, is automatic and cost-free. Medicare Part B, covering certain care in the
community, is optional and subject to a $58.70 monthly premium in 2003. This premium can
be paid by the Medicaid program, under either the Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB)
or Selected Low-Income Beneficiaries (SLMB) programs if the individual has limited income
and resources. Medicare coverage is not as comprehensive as that offered through Medicaid.
Medicare is also available to persons with end-stage renal disease even if they do not
receive SSDI benefits.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><big><strong>A Few Words About SSI's Disability Criteria</strong></big></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A detailed discussion of SSI's
rules for establishing disability is beyond the scope of this article. However, a few
basic principles can be stated. For adults, i.e., persons age 18 or older, the SSI program
will apply the same standard of disability as the SSDI program. This adult disability
standard is very strict. Generally, a person is not considered disabled if capable of some
significant work that exists in the national economy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For children under 18, the SSI
program applies a somewhat different standard of disability. Although that standard can
vary from disability to disability it is, typically, even more strict than the disability
standard for adults. If a child is approved for SSI, upon reaching 18 he or she will be
scheduled for an &quot;age 18 redetermination.&quot; This means that the case will be
reviewed to see if the young adult is eligible under the adult disability standard. This
is different from the &quot;continuing disability review,&quot; the periodic review
(generally, every three to five years) that every SSI or SSDI beneficiary will face to
determine if their disability continues.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Appeals</strong>. What
if a child seeking SSI or an adult seeking SSI or SSDI is denied benefits? What if upon
review, SSA finds that the person is no longer disabled and plans to terminate benefits?
SSA's rules provide for an appeals process and a majority of individuals who appeal win
their appeals. Free legal services are available through the Disability Advocacy Program
(DAP) to assist individuals with appeals. For help in locating the DAP program in your
area, call the State Work Incentives Support Center at 1-888-224-3272 (toll free).</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong><big>Some Basic Financial Rules Which Apply to SSI</big></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SSI is a program for the
financially needy. SSI can be the only source of income or can supplement some other
source of income such as Social Security benefits. In New York, the SSI program's monthly
payment rates for 2003 are as follows:</p>

$987</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The $575 rate is the typical
maximum payment rate for a child living at home with a parent or parents.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is a simplified
SSI calculation for an adult with unearned income. Joe, age 18, lives with his parents and
receives $320 in SSDI benefits. The first $20 will be disregarded ($320 - 20 = $300) and
the remainder will be subtracted from the maximum SSI rate of $575 since Joe is paying his
share of household expenses. The SSI check will be $275 ($575 - 300). Since Joe qualifies
for SSI, he will get Medicaid automatically.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong><big>SSI's Income and Resource Rules</big></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SSI's Income Rules</strong>.
The SSI check is calculated by considering all available income. For children under 18,
part of the parents' income is counted if that income is high enough. For children 18 or
older, the parents' income is <u>not</u> counted. <strong>This rule is very important.</strong>
When planning a student's transition from high school to college, work, or other adult
activities, you can assume that a child with a severe disability is likely to be eligible
for SSI and Medicaid at age 18, even if the parents' income is very high.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SSI program defines income
as anything received in cash or in kind that can be used to meet a person's needs for<u>
food,</u> <u>clothing</u> or <u>shelter</u>. &quot;In kind&quot; income includes gifts of
food, clothing or shelter. Be careful with gifts from relatives or fund raisers for
children with disabilities. If the cash received can be used for food, clothing or
shelter, it is considered income.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a child under age 18, what
parental income is counted in determining the SSI eligibility? Here is where the rules get
extremely complicated and confusing. While we will not attempt to explain this
calculation, a few basic principles should be understood.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; The concept of
&quot;deeming.&quot;</strong> SSI assumes that certain money is needed to meet the needs
of mom, dad, and the other kids. After assigning specific amounts of the parent(s)' income
to the other household members, the remaining income is deemed available to meet the needs
of the child with a disability. A child is entitled to the maximum SSI amount for a person
in his or her living circumstances minus income of parent(s) which is &quot;deemed&quot;
available to the child. If the child lives with the parents and $300 of parental income is
deemed to the child, the child will usually get a monthly SSI check of $275 (maximum
amount of $575 - 300). Under SSI's rules, the income of a parent or a stepparent is
counted or &quot;deemed&quot; only if the parent or stepparent lives in the same household
as the child. If a parent lives elsewhere, that parent's income will only be counted if it
is actually paid to support the child, usually in the form of child support payments.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; SSI's Resource Rules</strong>.
A person is only eligible for SSI if resources are within certain limits. For children
under 18, both the child's and the parents' resources are counted if the parents'
resources are high enough. For children 18 and older, the parents' resources do not count.
Resources include cash, other liquid assets, or any real or personal property that an
individual owns and can convert to cash for support and maintenance. An individual may
have up to $2,000 and a couple may have up to $3,000 in resources. For children under age
18, each child may have $2,000 in resources. A parent may have an additional $2,000 if
there is one parent and $3,000 if there are two parents. For example, if John and Mary
have only one child, Jimmy and they apply for SSI benefits on his behalf, the family could
have $5,000 in resources.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many resources are exempt and
are not counted by the SSI program. Here are some examples of exempt resources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The entire value of a house which a person, or a child's parent(s) uses as a home</li>
  <li>An automobile with a fair market value up to $4,500</li>
  <li>An automobile (of any value) necessary for travel to employment or medical treatment, or
    which is modified for use by a person with a disability</li>
  <li>A burial plot</li>
  <li>A $1,500 burial reserve</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two sets of exclusions apply,
one for the parent(s) and one for the child, except for the home (one per family).</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong><big>Eligibility Calculations &#150; When is a Child Eligible
for SSI?</big></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much will the child get
each month? When will the parent(s)' income be too high for the child to qualify for SSI?
The formula for calculating a child's SSI check is very complicated and will not be
presented here. There are, however, some examples listed below which give an idea when
families can expect their children with disabilities to be eligible for SSI.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Break even&quot;
points for deeming of parent(s)' income</strong>. A &quot;break even point&quot; is the
point at which the countable monthly income of the parent(s) is exactly equal to the
maximum SSI rate for the child and no SSI benefits would be paid. For a family with less
income than the break-even point, the child will be eligible for some SSI. The following
tables and examples show what this means for households of various sizes and with various
amounts of income. These tables can only be used when a parent has either unearned income
only or earned income (wages) only.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SSI program will exclude
and not count the first $65 of monthly gross wages (or, will exclude $85 if the person has
no unearned income). An additional 50 percent of gross monthly wages will also be
excluded. What remains is subtracted from the SSI base rate to determine the SSI check.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>The Student Earned
Income Exclusion</strong>. To qualify for this exclusion, the student must be under age
22, not married or a head of household, and regularly attending a school, college,
university, or course of vocational training. During calendar year 2003, the first $1,340
of gross monthly earnings are excluded, up to a maximum of $5,410 per year, with the
amount adjusted each year based on a cost-of-living index.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example # 1: Larry is a 17 year
old high school student with a learning disability. He receives the full $575 monthly SSI
check as his parents' income is not very high. Larry works at a summer job and earns $685
gross during both July and August. As noted in the previous example, if Larry was an adult
and received no student earned income exclusion, $300 of his earnings would count and his
SSI check would be reduced to $275 per month. Since Larry qualifies for the student earned
income exclusion, none of his monthly wages will count (i.e., the wages are below $1,340
per month) and his countable income will be $0 per month. His SSI check will remain at
$575 and his Medicaid will continue.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example # 2: Jose, age 20, is
deaf and receives a monthly SSI check of $575 as he lives with his parents. He attends
college full time and does not work during the school year. During June, July, and August,
he earns $1,725 gross each month (a little more than $10 per hour for a full time job).
This will be Jose's SSI budget with the student exclusion:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jose gets a monthly SSI check of $425, despite monthly earnings of more
than $1,700, and his Medicaid will continue. Since Jose is allowed a maximum yearly
exclusion of $5,410 and will use $4,020 during the summer months, he will have an
additional $1,390 to exclude in wages if he works during the Fall semester.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1619(b)
Medicaid</strong>. This special work incentive allows Medicaid to continue when the person
loses SSI cash benefits because of wages. So long as the person has a continuing
disability, would still be eligible for SSI if not for the wages, and has annual wages of
$34,136 or less in 2003, Medicaid should continue. Future Medicaid eligibility under
section 1619(b), or under the new Medicaid Buy-In provision to be implemented in July 2003
(see box, p.67), will be an important part of transition planning for many students. As
young adults, many of these students will not be able to work without Medicaid in place.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example # 1: Joanna, age 24 and
a recent college graduate, received a $639 SSI check until she went to work. Medicaid is
important to Joanna, who has cerebral palsy, as it pays for 30 hours per week in home
health services and will pay for her power wheelchair when it needs to be replaced. She
goes to work and earns $1,500 in gross wages per month ($18,000 per year). At this level
of wages, she will lose her right to an SSI check. For a person who lives alone and is not
eligible for the student earned income exclusion (e.g., persons age 22 or older), $1,363
or more in monthly wages would result in countable income of $639 or more and
ineligibility for SSI based on 2003 rates. Even though Joanna will lose her SSI check she
will remain eligible for Medicaid under the 1619(b) program, if she is still disabled, has
gross wages below $34,136 per year, and would still be eligible for SSI if she did not
have wages.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example # 2: Gloria, age 23,
lives with her parent and receives $520 in SSDI benefits and $75 in SSI. Gloria depends on
Medicaid to pay for counseling and medication to treat her mental illness. Based on 2003
SSI rates, Gloria will lose her SSI payment if her gross wages from a job are $235 or more
per month (a little more than 10 hours per week at the minimum wage). Assume Gloria loses
her SSI check by going to work and earning $400 per month. She will be able to keep her
Medicaid, through the 1619(b) program, if she is still disabled and would still be
eligible for SSI if she did not have wages. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gloria's right to an SSDI check
would not be affected under these facts, as her monthly wages are below the 2003
substantial gainful activity figure of $800 per month.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong><big>Receipt of SSI or SSDI Ensures Automatic Financial
Eligibility for VESID and Commission for the Blind Services</big></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A key component of any
transition plan, for a special education student, is the linkage to either the Office of
Vocational and Educational Services for Individuals with Disabilities (VESID) or the
Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped (CBVH) at the earliest possible date (no
later than the last year of high school). Although VESID and CBVH can fund a wide array of
services, most services (e.g., college tuition, transportation, assistive technology)
require that the individual meet financial need requirements. [For a more detailed
discussion of VESID and CBVH, see the Fall 2001 issue of the IMPACT newsletter, available
on the Neighborhood Legal Services website at: www.nls.org/at/atfall01.htm.]</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal regulations governing
VESID and CBVH provide that recipients of either SSI or SSDI benefits are automatically
held to meet the agency's financial need criteria. Absent eligibility for SSI or SSDI,
both agencies would consider the income and resources of the parents in determining
eligibility of most children and young adults with disabilities. VESID's new policies
recognize that individuals who no longer get an SSI check, but remain eligible for
Medicaid through section 1619(b), are protected by this rule and automatically meet
financial need criteria.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong><big>CONCLUSION</big></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This article has focused on
some of the core issues involving transition-aged students and SSI eligibility. It has
also focused on two of the key work incentives available to the student or young person
who goes to work - - the student earned income exclusion and 1619(b) Medicaid. The reader
is encouraged to review the other newsletters in our Benefits Planner series for a fuller
appreciation of the SSI, SSDI, and Medicaid rules that apply to youth with disabilities.</p>

2003</big></big></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Medicaid Buy-In is a
special work incentive now offered in 25 states. It will allow individuals with
disabilities to retain Medicaid at significant earnings levels even if the individual
would not be eligible under the 1619(b) program. New York was to start its buy-in program
on April 1, 2003, but that start-up date has been delayed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The governor's office has
announced that the buy-in will be available on July 1, 2003. According to an article that
appeared in the Albany Times Union on April 3, 2003, the buy-in will be available to
individuals who earn up to $46,170 per year. Anyone earning more than $26,000 annually
will be required to pay a premium, with the highest premiums about $2,000 per year.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming that regulations and
policies on this new program are available, we plan to dedicate a portion of our Summer
2003 newsletter to an explanation of this new program.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong><big><big>The Technical Assistance Corner</big></big><br>
Deeming, Child Support, and SSI's Plan for Achieving Self Support</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Question</strong>: I
recently got divorced. My son, James, is 15 and about to begin his third year of high
school. He is an honor student and would like to become a lawyer, but will have many extra
expenses because he is spinal cord injured and uses a wheelchair. Based on my monthly
gross pay of $2,139 ($25,668 per year), James gets an SSI check of $120 per month and
Medicaid. My husband has agreed to pay child support of $600 per month. How will the child
support affect James' SSI and Medicaid? Is there anything I can do to protect the SSI and
Medicaid? Are there any special programs that would pay for a specially modified van so
that James can eventually drive to work?</em></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Answer:</strong> The SSI
program is counting $455 of your monthly income in calculating your son's monthly
check.&nbsp; Under SSI's rules, they will also count two thirds of the child support
payments or $400 per month. &nbsp;This would increase James&#146; countable income to $855
per month and make him ineligible for SSI and Medicaid.&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Here is an alternative way for your ex-husband to meet the child support
obligation. &nbsp; Instead of paying cash to you, he could agree to pay the following
monthly bills directly: telephone, including second phone line for internet ($70),
internet service ($20), YMCA membership for James ($25), cable television ($50), loan
payments for ramp ($80), existing car payments ($200), and car insurance payments
($155).&nbsp; Assuming the court approves this arrangement, since this $600 is now paid
directly to vendors (for expenses that you are already incurring), the money is not
available to pay for James&#146; food, clothing, and shelter. &nbsp; Therefore, none of it
counts as income for SSI purposes and his SSI check remains at $120, with automatic
Medicaid. [For a more detailed discussion on creative child support settlements for
children with disabilities, see SSI and the Family Law Attorney, available on the
Neighborhood Legal Services website at: <a href="http://www.nls.org/ssifmaty.htm">www.nls.org/ssifmaty.htm</a>.]</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing you should
consider is SSI's Plan for Achieving Self Support (PASS).&nbsp; When countable income is
put into an approved PASS for items to support a vocational goal, such as the purchase of
a vehicle to travel to work and college, that money does not count in determining SSI
eligibility. &nbsp; If $455 of your monthly income (i.e., the amount currently counted by
SSI) is put into a PASS to eventually purchase a van, the income will no longer count and
James'; SSI check will increase from $120 to $575 per month. &nbsp; Assuming this money is
set aside monthly for 30 months (i.e., until James'; 18th birthday), he will be able to
save more than $15,000 toward the purchase of a new van and the total disposable income to
your two-person household will remain the same.&nbsp; The Office of Vocational and
Educational Services for Individuals with Disabilities (VESID) should then be able to pay
for the $10,000 to $20,000 in modifications to allow James to drive the van from his
wheelchair.</p>

<p>New York State is home to some of the country's most advanced programs and recognized
experts in the arena of benefits planning and assistance. Recognizing the critical link
between benefits planning and supporting the employment of people with disabilities, the
New York State Developmental Disabilities Planning Council established the New York State
Work Incentives Support Center in October of 2000-a collaborative venture between Cornell
University's Program on Employment and Disability and Neighborhood Legal Services, Inc.
Since its inception, the Center has sought to develop the human resources and policies and
practices necessary to support the movement of New Yorkers who receive public benefits
into employment.</p>

    the fall of 2002, the Center conducted an impact assessment of end users to determine
    effectiveness and impact of services provided. In addition, the survey attempted to gauge
    next steps for the ongoing development of the field of benefits planning in New York
    State. A full report of this assessment and/or copy of the survey instrument can be
    obtained by contacting the Center's toll free number, 1-888224-3272. Five hundred end
    users of services were randomly selected to participate in the needs assessment. Of those
    selected, 229 individuals responded to the initial survey which incorporated 20 questions.</p>
    <p>47% of respondents to the survey reported being either a person with a disability, a
    family member of a person with a disability or support person. 27% reported being
    providers of services with 16% reporting some other classification. Further, survey
    responders also reported working in the following fields: mental health (17%); vocational
    rehabilitation (12%); mental retardation / developmental disabilities (11 %); education
    (15%); advocacy (12%) and, employment and labor (17%) with 30% of the respondents
    reporting working for state agencies.</p>
    <p>The survey went on to inquire as to the impact specific services and support had -
    &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;somewhaf 'or &quot;definitely.&quot; The majority of
    respondents clearly felt the core services and supports provided &quot;definitely&quot;
    helped them better serve individuals who received Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and
    Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) (newsletter-82%, phone support-85% and
    training-86%). Further, a majority confirmed that these three core services
    &quot;definitely&quot; assisted them in supporting someone in getting a job (newsletter-5
    1 %, phone support-59% and training-59%). Of those responding to the survey, 96% felt that
    training and technical support on Social Security issues was needed and valued and further
    that a statewide Benefits Planning Association was needed (92%) to assist with the ongoing
    development of the field. 66% of respondents felt that New York State needed a more formal
    process for credentialing benefits planners and 77% of respondents felt that disability
    agencies within New York State should subscribe to a common benefits planning standard.</td>
