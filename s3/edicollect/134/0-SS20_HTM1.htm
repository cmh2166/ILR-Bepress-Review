<p align="center"><strong><big><big><big>A Journey Through the Maze of Social Security
Benefits &amp; Work:<br>
</big></big></big>The Case of Julie and How a Benefits Specialist Would Counsel Her Along
the Way </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)
and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries have long faced major barriers when
they considered working. They feared that any work activity would trigger continuing
disability reviews and that work would be held against them during that review. In
addition, beneficiaries who qualified for both SSDI and SSI had to be familiar with the
rules of each program. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This article will, by using a case scenario,
walk through the issues a young woman, with a spinal cord injury caused by an automobile
accident at age 16, might face on the road to self support. We will trace her ups and
downs, over a period of nearly 12 years, as she transitions from dependent's benefits as a
child to SSDI and SSI benefits as a young adult. In stages, we will follow her as she goes
through the early years of life on benefits, her attempts to work, her college experience,
her euphoria once finding employment after college, and then the effects of her disability
on her work. At each stage, we will analyze what can be expected to happen with her
benefits and how a Benefits Planning, Assistance and Outreach (BPA&amp;O) project's
benefits specialist might assist her so she can make informed choices about which path to
go down. <br>
To present this full scenario and the benefits rules in an understandable format, we have
expanded our usual seven-page newsletter by four additional pages. Readers may want to
read through the article more than once, however, to fully appreciate the interplay of the
various SSDI and SSI rules. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>Julie's Injury at Age 16: 2001 </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julie incurred a spinal cord injury in a car
accident at age 16. At that time she was already receiving a Social Security dependent's
benefit since her father was an insured worker who died when she was 10 years old. See
Technical Assistance Corner, page 114, for a discussion of Social Security dependent's
benefits. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resources and SSI Benefits For Children:
After Julie's accident, her mother filed an SSI application but Julie was not found
eligible because she had significant deemed resources from her mother and stepfather and a
$100,000 cash settlement related to Julie's car accident. <br>
Here's how the SSI resource rules work. The value of resources belonging to certain
parents/stepparents is counted as a resource of the child whether or not the resource is
actually available to the child, subject to applicable exclusions and limits. Resources
include cash, other liquid assets or any real or personal property that an individual owns
and can convert to cash for support and maintenance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be eligible for SSI, an individual may
have up to $2,000 and a couple may have up to $3,000 in resources. Children under age 18
may have $2,000 in resources. Now the rules for parent-to-child deeming get tricky. Only
the countable resources of a parent or a step-parent living in the same household of a
child are considered. All the countable resources over the resource limit for an
individual ($2,000), if one parent lives in the household, or a couple ($3,000), if two
parents live in the household, are deemed available to the child. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that two sets of exclusions
apply: one for the parent(s) and one for the child, except for the home (one per family).
Other children in the household are also allowed to have up to the resource limit for an
individual ($2,000 each). Finally, pension funds of the parent(s) are not deemed to the
child. In Julie's case, the deemed resources were substantial and made her ineligible for
SSI at least through her 18th birthday. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>Julie's Transition To The Adult World: 2003 </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2003, when Julie turned 18, the Social
Security Administration (SSA) conducted a disability determination and found her disabled.
The dependent's check became an SSDI Disabled Adult Child (DAC) benefit (also known as
Childhood Disability Benefits) of $378 per month effective with the month she became 18.
Julie was eligible for DAC benefits under her father's earnings record as he had died and
she became disabled prior to age 22. Julie would also have been eligible for DAC benefits
if her father had retired or become disabled. <br>
Before Julie turned 18, her parents used the insurance settlement to make significant home
modifications to accommodate Julie's disability. In June of 2003, shortly after Julie
graduated from high school, her parents used the remainder of the settlement to pay off
their mortgage and then deeded the home over to Julie. Julie continued to reside in the
home, but her parents bought a condo for themselves and moved out. Julie used her SSDI
benefits to pay for her own food, clothing and shelter. Her attendant care is provided by
a local agency and paid for by Medicaid. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Julie was not working and had no other
form of unearned income or resources, Julie's parents wondered whether she should once
again apply for SSI. They visited their local BPA&amp;O specialist and asked whether Julie
will now be eligible for SSI and if so, how much Julie's SSI payment would be. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julie's parents instincts are right on
target. Once Julie turns 18, the parents' income and resources are no longer deemed
available to her. Additionally, Julie's home, though a resource, is excluded as she lives
in it. The BPA&amp;O specialist explains this to the parents and informs them that since
Julie now lives on her own and receives no in-kind support, has no current earnings, and
has no unearned income other than $378 in SSDI benefits, she should be eligible for SSI.
As Julie lives alone, the maximum SSI she would receive in 2003 would be the federal
benefit rate of $552 plus an $87 state supplement for a total of $639. From that total,
SSI will subtract $358 of unearned SSDI benefits as SSI disregards the first $20 of
unearned income ($378 - 20 = $358), thus providing Julie with an SSI check of $281 ($639 -
358 = $281) and automatic Medicaid. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>JULIE'S TRIAL WORK PERIOD: AUGUST 2003-APRIL 2004 </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In August of 2003, Julie begins working as a
receptionist 20 hours per week at $8.00 per hour. She wants to know how earning $688 per
month (20 x 8 x 4.3) would affect her cash benefits and Medicaid. First, let's look at the
effect of her earnings on her SSDI check. Since Julie has never worked since she started
receiving DAC benefits, she is entitled to a trial work period (TWP). </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>Trial Work Period Principles </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This nine-month period allows SSDI
beneficiaries to test their ability to work without losing benefits. (The SSI program has
no TWP). During the nine TWP months, the individual will be allowed to get both a paycheck
and an SSDI check no matter what the amount of earnings. The nine months need not be
consecutive. Once an individual has used up nine TWP months within any 60-month period,
the TWP is over. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1990 and 2000, a TWP &#147;services
month&#148; was any month in which gross earnings were $200 or more. This was increased to
$530 effective January 2001. Starting with 2002, this amount has increased each year based
on increases in the National Wage Index. If the index remains the same or goes down, the
amount considered to be a TWP month will remain at the previous year's level. Effective
January 2003, the TWP was increased to $570. In January 2004, SSA increased it to $580. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Back to Julie's case:</strong> Julie
worked her first TWP month in August 2003. This is the first month she worked as an SSDI
beneficiary and earned more than the TWP services month amount ($570 in 2003). </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julie continues to work and earn $688 per
month through 2003 and all of 2004. She worries about her SSDI benefits. Since Julie earns
at least $570 in gross wages for five months in 2003 and then earns at least $580 in gross
wages for the first four months of 2004, she completes her TWP in nine consecutive months,
August 2003 to April 2004. During the nine TWP months, Julie will continue to get her SSDI
check. </p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>EFFECT OF EARNINGS DURING TWP ON JULIE'S SSI </strong></big></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Julie begins to earn $688 per month she
will lose her SSI benefit. You will recall that Julie was receiving $378 in SSDI (i.e.,
unearned income) and, as a result, her SSI check was $281. Now, we must add her earned
income into the equation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earned income is income from work, including
gross wages, salary and tips. It also includes net earnings from self-employment.
Sheltered workshop wages are classified as earned income and must be considered in
determining SSI income eligibility and benefit amount. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SSI will disregard the first $65 of earned
income ($85 if there is no unearned income) and 50 percent of remaining earned income.
What is left is subtracted from the base rate. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julie's SSI calculation: First, the unearned
income is budgeted. Julie has $358 of countable unearned income. Second, the earned
income, $688, is budgeted. The first $65 is not counted, leaving $623 in countable wages.
Next, this is reduced by $311.50, half of the remaining gross wages. Thus, Julie has
$311.50 of countable earned income. Third, the countable unearned and countable earned
income are added together to arrive at the total countable income. In Julie's case, the
countable unearned income of $358 and the countable earned income of $311.50 add up to
$669.50 of countable income. That figure is then subtracted from the appropriate SSI rate.
In Julie's case, as she lives alone, that figure in 2003 was $639. As $669.50 is greater
than $639, Julie would no longer be eligible for an SSI check. When the Federal Benefit
Rate increased by $12 in 2004, Julie was still ineligible for SSI as her countable income
of $669.50 is still greater than the $651 living alone rate in New York. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about her Medicaid? Section 1619(b)
allows automatic Medicaid to continue if a person loses SSI due to wages. If the person is
still disabled and would be eligible for SSI if the wages were not counted, Medicaid
should continue. In New York, the 2003 and 2004 income limits were $34,136 and $34,765,
respectively, in wages per year. (Stay tuned to this newsletter for the 2005 income
limits.) The income limit can be higher if medical expenses are high enough. Thus, in
Julie's case, she loses her SSI cash benefit but retains her Medicaid pursuant to 1619(b)
as her annual earnings are well below the threshold amount. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>JULIE's EXTENDED PERIOD OF ELIGIBILITY: MAY 2004-APRIL 2007
</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julie continues to work and earn $688 per
month after she exhausts the trial work period. She wants to know what happens to her
benefits beginning May 2004. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>Extended Period of Eligibility Principles </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extended period of eligibility (EPE),
like the TWP, applies only to SSDI beneficiaries. It does not apply to SSI recipients
because substantial gainful activity (SGA) is not a factor in SSI payments. The EPE is
sometimes referred to as the re-entitlement period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 36-month EPE immediately follows the
ninth TWP month. The 36 months run consecutively whether the individual is working or not.
During these 36 months, the SSDI beneficiary can move in and out of benefits status
depending upon monthly earnings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is how the EPE works. The first month
during the EPE that the individual has gross earnings above the SGA limit will be
considered the &#147;benefit cessation month.&#148; In all cases, the individual will
continue to receive SSDI for the benefit cessation month and the following two months.
These three months are known as the &#147;grace period.&#148; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the grace period, and for the
remainder of the EPE, the right to an SSDI check will depend on monthly wages: 

<ul>
  <li>when countable wages are above the 2004 SGA level of $810 (as adjusted in year 2005 and
    later), the individual will not get an SSDI check</li>
  <li>when countable wages are below $810, the individual will get an SSDI check</li>
</ul>

<p>Impairment related work expenses and subsidies will be subtracted from gross monthly
wages to determine countable wages (this will be discussed in a future newsletter). </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon completion of the EPE, if a person is
not performing SGA (i.e., not earning more than $810 in 2004), their SSDI benefits will
continue. Historically, a person who performed SGA after the EPE would lose entitlement to
SSDI. If countable wages later go below the SGA amount, it would take a new application to
re-establish eligibility. This has changed under the new, expedited reinstatement
provisions summarized below. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>Application of the EPE: Julie's Case</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As noted above, Julie begins work in August
2003 and earns $688 per month (all figures refer to gross wages) between August 2003 and
December 2004. In January 2005, she increases her hours, gets a raise, and earns $1032 per
month throughout all of 2005 and for the first four months of 2006. In late April 2006,
Julie is laid off and earns no money between May and December 2006. Julie's EPE began in
May 2004 (i.e., immediately following her ninth TWP month). Her 36-month EPE will run from
May 2004 though April 2007. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julie is clearly eligible for SSDI between
May 2004 and December 2004. Her gross wages of $688 per month were less than the SGA
amount in effect at that time and her eligibility continued. (Remember: The SGA level
increased to $810 effective January 2004. We will assume that the SGA level remains the
same for the remainder of Julie's disability period.) </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; January 2005, when Julie earns $1032 per
month, will be considered her &#147;benefit cessation month.&#148; This is the first month
of SGA during her EPE. (Again, we assume that the SGA level stays at $810 for the duration
of this example.) Julie is entitled to SSDI benefits for January, February and March 2005
- - the benefit cessation month and two more months (i.e., her three-month grace period). </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting in April 2005, Julie will get
checks only when her countable wages are below the SGA amount. Since her gross earnings
were $1032 per month throughout the remainder of 2005 - - more than the 2005 SGA amount of
$810 for purposes of this exercise - - she will not receive an SSDI check during the April
through December 2005 period. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julie will not receive a check for January
through April of 2006 either. During those four months, Julie continued to earn $1032,
well above the SGA level for 2006. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting in May 2006, Julie will start
getting SSDI checks again, as she is still in her EPE, which runs from May 2004 through
April 2007. Since she was out of work and earned nothing, Julie's income was below the SGA
level. Remember, during the EPE, Julie will get checks only when her countable wages are
below the SGA level. She will get SSDI checks for May through December 2006 as her
earnings remained below the SGA level when she was out of work and earned nothing. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>Julie's SSI During The EPE: April 2005-April 2006 </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Julie is working, earning $688, and
receiving her DAC check of $378 through December 2004, Julie is not eligible for SSI
during that period. In April 2005, when her income remains at $1032 and she receives no
SSDI check, Julie will become entitled to SSI again. Because she still received 1619(b)
Medicaid, Julie maintained her connection to the SSI program. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The budgeting to ascertain whether Julie
would be eligible for any SSI goes as follows: Julie has earnings of $1032 per month.
Since she has no unearned income, the $20 general disregard is deducted from the earned
income ($1032 &#150; 20 = $1012). Now, the next $65 is not counted, leaving $947 in
countable wages. Next, the countable income would be reduced by $473.50, half of the
remaining gross wages. Thus, Julie has $473.50 of countable earned income. The countable
earned income of $473.50 is then subtracted from the appropriate SSI rate. Let's assume
that rate remains $651. Julie would be eligible for $177.50 per month in SSI beginning in
April 2005 and through April 2006. This is very important. Notice that by keeping her
connection to the SSI program through 1619(b) Medicaid, once Julie became ineligible for
SSDI due to income, her SSI kicked back in again. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>JULIE'S RETURN TO SCHOOL: SEPTEMBER 2006</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In May 2006, when Julie is laid off, she
decides she wants to do more with her life than be a part-time receptionist! She is
interested in opening up a bookkeeping service out of her home where she has the potential
to earn $35,000 per year. She plans to begin classes in September 2006. The educational
program typically lasts two years, but Julie plans to take three years to complete the
program due to her disability. Tuition, fees, supplies, and books will cost a total of
$21,000 over the 3-year period. Julie applies for a PELL grant and is found eligible for
tuition assistance of $3,000 per year. She takes out a student loan to cover the remaining
costs. She also estimates that door-to-door van transportation to and from school will
cost $700 per month. New York's Office of Vocational and Educational Services to
Individuals with Disabilities (VESID) agrees to cover her transportation costs and
assistive technology valued at $1,200. NOTE: Julie should also approach VESID for
additional help with her tuition, which VESID is authorized to fund in many cases. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the chart below shows, since Julie is not
working when her EPE ends in April 2007, she will continue receiving SSDI benefits as she
completes her educational program. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>THE EFFECT ON JULIE'S SSI WHEN LAID OFF: MAY 2006-JUNE 2009
</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Julie is laid off in May 2006, she is
still in her EPE. As she has no more earned income but once again has unearned income, the
amount of her SSI check will change again. SSI will subtract $358 of SSDI benefits as SSI
disregards the first $20 of unearned income ($378 - 20 = $358), thus providing Julie with
an SSI check of $293 ($651- 358 = $293). We are still assuming that Julie's SSDI and SSI
checks remain at the 2004 levels. NOTE: If Julie qualified for unemployment insurance
benefits (unearned income), that combined with her SSDI would probably make her ineligible
for SSI. She would be eligible for SSI after her unemployment benefits ceased. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>JULIE'S RETURN TO WORK AFTER THE EPE </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon graduating in June 2009, Julie decides
to work with a private firm rather than hang a shingle. She secures a full-time job
earning $42,000 a year and begins this job in early July 2009. She continues to earn at
that level throughout the remainder of 2009 and 2010. What will this employment do her
SSDI check? </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julie's EPE ended at the end of April 2007.
She continued receiving SSDI benefits thereafter as her earnings were below the SGA level.
Now, in July 2009, she will not be eligible for SSDI checks because she is performing SGA
after her EPE (see chart below). </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>EXPEDITED REINSTATEMENT OF SSDI: JANUARY 2011 </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January of 2011, Julie must stop working
due to residual pain from her automobile accident and remains out of work for the entire
year, January to December 2011. In January 2012, Julie returns to work on a lighter
schedule. She has gross monthly earnings of $500 between January and December 2012. In
January 2013, she increases her hours of work and has gross monthly earnings of $1,000
between January and December 2013. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>EXR Principles </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expedited reinstatement (EXR) program
has allowed more SSDI and SSI beneficiaries attempt to work, despite a severe disability,
knowing they may re-establish eligibility if their work is not sustained because of their
impairment(s). Effective January 2001, a person who performs SGA after the EPE, and had
his or her benefits terminated and later has wages reduced below SGA levels because of an
impairment(s) or health condition, will be reinstated to SSDI, without a new application,
if the individual: 

<ul>
  <li>was eligible for SSDI;</li>
  <li>lost SSDI due to performance of SGA (i.e., in 2004 by earning more than $810 per month
    or $1,350 if legally blind);</li>
  <li>requests reinstatement within 60 months of the last month of entitlement, or establishes
    good cause for missing the 60-month deadline;</li>
  <li>has a disability that is the same as (or related to) the physical or mental disability
    that was the basis for their original claim; and</li>
  <li>that disability renders the individual incapable of SGA based on application of the
    medical improvement standard. </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If an individual believes he or she meets
the EXR criteria, the individual should contact SSA and request reinstatement. This
includes individuals who in the last five years stopped receiving benefits due to SGA and
who, since their last month of SSDI entitlement, also stopped performing SGA because of
their impairment(s) or health condition. If the beneficiary satisfies the EXR criteria,
both their benefits and the benefits of dependents can be reinstated. SSDI dependent's
benefits, including benefits for children and spouses, can be reinstated if the dependent
satisfies all the eligibility criteria as a dependent (this includes having a new medical
determination if the dependent's entitlement is based on being disabled.) A previously
entitled dependent does not have to file a new application to qualify for reinstated
benefits. New dependents, however, will have to file an application to qualify for
reinstated benefits. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>Provisional Benefits Pending Reinstatement Decision </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the EXR request is pending, the
individual is eligible for up to six consecutive months of provisional benefits.
Provisional benefits are payable when EXR is requested. The individual may also be
eligible for Medicare coverage while receiving provisional benefits, if not already
covered for such benefits. Provisional benefits may be suspended under current rules
(e.g., prisoner suspension), and performing SGA will terminate provisional benefits.
Reports are that SSA is processing these requests quickly and individuals have received
provisional benefits within weeks of the EXR request. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens if SSA later determines that
the individual was not entitled to reinstatement? Must they repay the provisional benefits
received? SSA's policy states that any resulting overpayment cannot be recovered unless
SSA determines that the individual knew or should have known that he or she did not meet
the EXR criteria. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>A New Trial Work Period and Extended Period of Eligibility </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For years, SSDI beneficiaries were told they
would get one TWP and one EPE. The TWP and EPE could be exhausted for good at very low
levels of earnings. In fact, the EPE could be exhausted whether the person was working or
not. This has changed under the new EXR program.<br>
After being paid 24 months (need not be consecutive) of reinstated benefits (including any
months for which provisional and retroactive payments were actually received), the
beneficiary gets: a new TWP, a new EPE, and another 60-month period in which to request
EXR if benefits are terminated again due to SGA. As demonstrated in the continuation of
Julie's case, the chance for a new TWP and EPE, fortunately, allows the person to work
through the peaks and valleys of their continuing disability.. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>Julie's EXR, New TWP and EPE</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>EXR Eligibility:</strong> Since
Julie stopped working for health reasons, she became eligible for EXR in January 2011,
because her wages were now below the SGA amount, it was within 60 months of her last month
of entitlement to SSDI (i.e., within 60 months of July 2009), and the other EXR criteria
are met (i.e., has the same or related impairment and is disabled based on the application
of medical improvement criteria). We assume that Julie would have applied for EXR as early
as January 2011, or as soon as it became apparent that she would not return to work right
away. We expect that Julie would be eligible for up to six months of provisional benefits
while her EXR request was being processed. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts indicate that Julie had no
earnings during 2011 and her wages during 2012 were $500 per month, well below the SGA
level. In addition, having been found to meet the EXR medical criteria, Julie is eligible
for EXR benefits for all of 2011 and 2012, a 24-month period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A new TWP and EPE: </strong>When Julie's
earnings increase in January 2013, she will be entitled to a new TWP. This is because
Julie received reinstated benefits for at least 24 months. Since she will earn over the
TWP amount in 2013 (as adjusted for wage inflation), her new TWP would run from January
through September 2013. Her new EPE would start in October 2013 and run for 36 months
through September 2016. The same EPE rules would apply as did in the earlier years. </p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>JULIE'S MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY: 2009 </strong></big></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In July 2009, when Julie earns $3,500, she
loses both her SSDI and SSI checks. She also becomes ineligible for 1619(b) Medicaid, as
her earnings will undoubtedly be above the income threshold, $34,765 (unchanged from the
2004 level for our purposes) and her medical expenses are not high enough to establish a
higher individualized eligibility threshold. Since Julie will be ineligible for 1619(b)
due to excess income for more than 12 months, she will lose her connection to the SSI
program. How will she meet her medical expenses, as her private insurance plan does not
cover home health care services and durable medical equipment is only partially covered?</p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>The Medicaid Buy-in Saves The Day For Julie</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucky for Julie, New York has a Medicaid
Buy-In for Working People with Disabilities (MBI-WPD) program. It covers workers over the
age of 16 and under the age of 65 who meet the definition of disability. To be eligible
for the program, an individual must: 

<ul>
  <li>Have a disability as defined by the SSA</li>
  <li>Be at least 16 but not yet 65 years of age</li>
  <li>Be engaged in paid work (includes part-time and full-time work)</li>
  <li>Have a gross income that may be as high as $47,580 for an individual and $63,492 for an
    eligible couple (as of January 1, 2004)</li>
  <li>Have non-exempt resources that do not exceed $10,000 </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Julie's earnings, $42,000, are below
the $47,580 level and she meets all the other criteria, she will qualify for New York's
MBI-WPD program. (See the two-part Medicaid Buy-In article in our Summer 2003 and Fall
2003 issues of The Benefits Planner.) </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>DOES EXR APPLY TO SSI? </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most SSI recipients who lose benefits due to
higher wages will retain an SSI connection through the 1619(b) Medicaid provisions. When
they once again become eligible for SSI through reduced wages, they can go back to cash
benefit status without the need to use the EXR rules.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most likely user of the EXR provisions
would be the SSI recipient who, like Julie, loses cash benefits because of wages or a
combination of wages and unearned income, then either loses or fails to establish 1619(b)
Medicaid eligibility. When that individual remains ineligible for either cash or 1619(b)
Medicaid benefits for 12 consecutive months, they will lose their connection to SSI. This
means a new application would be required, under pre-2001 rules, to re-establish
eligibility for cash benefits if wages were sufficiently reduced and the other SSI
requirements are met. Effective January 2001, that individual can most likely use the EXR
provisions to re-establish eligibility for SSI. All EXR requirements, as discussed above,
apply to the individual seeking reinstatement of SSI. In addition, the individual must
meet all SSI eligibility requirements related to income and resources. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January 2011, Julie can avail herself of
the EXR provisions and become eligible for SSI once again. The same criteria that apply
for SSDI apply to SSI. What will this mean with respect to Julie's SSI benefit? </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all of 2011, Julie has no earnings. As
she has no more earned income but once again has unearned income, she will become eligible
for an SSI check again. SSI will subtract $358 of unearned SSDI benefits as SSI disregards
the first $20 of unearned income ($378- 20 = $358), thus providing Julie with an SSI check
of $293 ($651- 358 = $293). We are still assuming that Julie's SSDI and SSI checks remain
at the 2004 levels. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2012, Julie returns to work and earns
$500 per month. The new SSI calculation is done in the same manner as previously explained
and laid out in the examples. First, the unearned income is budgeted ($378 &#150; 20 =
$358). Second, the earned income is budgeted ($500 &#150; 65 = $435\2 = $217.50). Third,
the countable unearned income and the countable earned income are added together to arrive
at the total countable income ($358 + 217.50 = $575.50). That figure is then subtracted
from the appropriate SSI rate. Julie will be eligible for an SSI check of $75.50 ($651-
575.50 = $75.50), again using 2004 SSI rates in our example. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>CONCLUSION </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This article has, by using a case scenario,
walked through the issues that many beneficiaries of SSI or SSDI or both will face as they
move down the road to self support and often back to receiving benefits again due to their
disability. While these scenarios require extensive analysis and research, with the facts
and SSA policies often changing, they present a realistic sample of the types of issues
that will confront the benefits specialist who works with a consumer like Julie. The
benefits specialist will be called upon to analyze this ever-changing set of facts, often
calling upon experts from other fields in order to provide the beneficiary with accurate
information or an appropriate referral for information. We hope this article has answered
some of the questions raised by consumers when they return to work and will help benefits
specialists everywhere understand the intricacies of working with people with disabilities
who return to work. As always, if you have questions, please call the State Work Incentive
Support Center's toll-free hotline, 1-888-224-3272.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question: I am a 41 year old widow with one
child, age 13. My son has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. Currently, we each get a
Social Security check on the earnings record of my deceased husband. My son gets $300 and
I get $300 as his parent. I work part-time and earn $800 per month in gross wages. I have
heard conflicting information about what will happen with these benefits as my son gets
older. Will I lose my benefits when my son turns 16? Will he lose his benefits when he
turns 18?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer: Ordinarily, a parent who is getting
Social Security survivor's benefits as the caretaker of a child will lose the right to
those benefits when that child (or the youngest child, if there are two or more children)
turns 16. If that child has a disability, as yours does, the parent's survivor's benefits
can continue so long as that child keeps getting benefits and you are providing essential
services for that child. So, your Social Security benefits could continue indefinitely.
For example, if he remains at home during college, your benefits could continue. Keep in
mind that if you start making more money at your job (i.e., more than $11,640 in 2004),
you can expect a gradual reduction in your monthly check (a $1 reduction for every $2 of
gross pay).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children getting Social Security survivors
benefits will continue to get benefits until age 18 or until age 19 if the child is still
in high school or elementary school. In your son's case, since he has a disability, you
can expect his benefits to be converted at age 18 to Social Security Disability Insurance
(SSDI) benefits as a Disabled Adult Child (DAC). These DAC benefits are often referred to
as Childhood Disability Benefits. The rate of payment would probably be the same as he is
getting now, subject to annual cost-of-living increases. He could continue to receive
benefits, in most cases, until he works at the substantial gainful activity level
following a trial work period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, you did not ask but it appears
that your son could be eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) based on the income
figures you have given us. Your combined incomes are low enough that he would probably be
entitled to an SSI check of about $180 per month if your resources are within the
program's limits. Keep in mind that if he qualifies for SSI he will be automatically
eligible for Medicaid. </p>
