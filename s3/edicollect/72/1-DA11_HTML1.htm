<h1><a name="_Toc152574874">Introduction</a></h1>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574875">Background of the Cornell Study</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>This is a four-year Research and Demonstration Project
funded by the U.S. Department of Education National Institute on Disability and
Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), to address ways to improve the employment practices
covered by Title I of the ADA. The study is administered by the Program on
Employment and Disability in the School of Industrial and Labor
Relations-Extension Division at Cornell University, in collaboration with the
Washington Business Group on Health, the Society for Human Resource Management,
and The Lewin Group.  The purpose of this effort is to investigate the impact
of the ADA on the employment practices of small, medium, and large private
sector businesses. The intended outcome of the research is to assist in the
identification of employment practices that have been the most challenging in
implementing the ADA, and to identify interventions that can be used by the
private sector employers and persons with disabilities to address these
employment practices.  Employment policy and practices that enhance both the
hiring and retention of workers with disabilities are being examined. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574876">Results to Date</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>   A representative sample of small, medium, and large
size employers were selected for study from the membership of the Washington
Business Group on Health (WBGH) and the Society for Human Resource Management
(SHRM).  A survey was conducted of almost 1,000 private sector employers, and
the results have been used to identify specific interventions to address
remaining barriers.  In addition, in Years Three and Four, case studies were
conducted by WBGH of six of their members, including CIGNA, Bank of America,
Hewlett-Packard, Ford Motor Company, Texas Instruments, and Proctor and
Gamble.  Results of these inquiries have assisted us in the identification of
progress made in the implementation of the ADA in Business organizations to
date, and remaining problem area and barriers to the employment and retention
of people with disabilities.  </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574877">E-Human Resources and Disability Nondiscrimination
Initiative</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>   In Year Four of this initiative, Cornell asked to amend
its proposed agenda to address information needs that might dovetail with the
newly articulated NIDRR Disability and Business Technical Assistance Center (DBTAC)
focus on access to information technology (IT) for persons with disabilities
that began October 1st, 2001.1   Therefore, the focus of Year Four has been an
inquiry into the current employer use of IT in the employment and human
resources management processes, and the accessibility of these services.  We
believe that examining the current use of information-based technologies (IT)
in the employment process will assist us in better understanding the skills
young people with disabilities need to access and stay in the workplace as
employees, as well as illustrating the needs of older employees.   This
information will also inform the DBTACs about the accommodation and IT
accessibility information needs of businesses, as well as how that will
translate to preparation of both young and older individuals with disabilities
for the work force.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574878">An Overview of This Article</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>   To accomplish this, an extensive review of the
literature on information technology applications to the employment process was
conducted.  Three human resources related uses of the Internet are explored in
this review of current literature:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>E-recruiting</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>E-benefits/HR</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>E-training</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Each of these areas can have a significant impact on
employees with disabilities, especially given the growth of business’ use of
the Web.  If E-recruiting is not accessible, it could prevent people from
applying for or even finding open positions. E-training, if not accessible,
could create a new barrier to the advancement of individuals who are unable to
access online training to improve or update their skills.  E-benefits, while
likely to make enrollment and other activities easier for many employees, may
become an obstacle for individuals with certain disabilities if not designed to
be accessible.   In addition, we examined the literature for any current
discussion of access issues for applicants and employees with disabilities by
business.  </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In the remainder of this introduction, we also cover the
World Wide Web and accessibility issues for people with disabilities,
legislation relevant to Internet accessibility, and studies of Web
accessibility</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574879">The World Wide Web and Accessibility</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>According to a U.S. Department of Commerce report (2000),
Americans are buying computers and connecting to the Internet at an unprecedented
rate. Over half of U.S. households (51.1%) in the U.S. now own a computer. In
the 20 months between December 1998 and August 2000 the share of households
with Internet access increased by 58%, from 26.2% to 41.5%. As of August 2000,
116 million Americans were online, accounting for 44.4% of the U.S. population (age three and older), up from 32.7% in December 1998.  In just 20 months,
31.9 million people became Internet users in the U.S. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>This amazing growth in computer and Internet use has not
been the same for individuals with disabilities. A report by the U.S.
Department of Commerce (2000) found that people with disabilities were half as
likely to have Internet access as those without a disability (21.6% versus
42.1%). Computer experience is much less common for those with disabilities.
Nearly three out of five of those with disabilities reported having never used
a personal computer, compared to slightly under a quarter of those without a
disability. Among those with a disability, those with vision or manual
dexterity problems are less likely to regularly use a computer or have Internet
access than those with hearing difficulties.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Kaye (2000) focused on those with access to a computer and
the Internet.  He analyzed uses of the Internet by those aged 15 years and
over, with and without a work disability, using 1998 and 1999 Census Bureau
data. For the most part the Internet uses of those with and without a
disability were very similar. The most common application was e-mail, used by
seven out of ten people with disabilities.  Six out of ten searched for
information, and four out of ten used the Internet for news and weather
information. About a third (29.3%) of those with a work disability reported
using the Internet for courses and schoolwork, compared to 35.2% of those
without a disability. Job related tasks were far less likely to be performed
online by those with a disability -- 26.2% as compared to 43.1% -- probably
reflecting the fact they are less likely to be employed. Interestingly, despite
this, individuals with disabilities are just as likely to use the Internet to
search for jobs as those without disabilities -- 15.9% and 16.7% respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Georgia Institute of Technology’s Graphic, Visualization,
and Usability Center's Web based survey, although outdated by Internet
standards (1998), gives another perspective on Web users with disabilities. 
Based on a sample of over 5,000 respondents, they found nearly one in ten
reported some type of disability: 3.6% reported being visually impaired, 2.0%
mobility impaired, 1.7% hearing impaired, and 0.5% cognitively impaired (an
additional 1.5% preferred not to say).  This survey clearly demonstrates that
people with disabilities are utilizing the Web. Note also that people with
disabilities in several of the categories mentioned are likely to encounter
some access problems if the Web sites are not designed with accessibility in
mind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Internet can make a significant difference to adults
with disabilities, according to an online poll by Harris Interactive (Taylor, 2000a). It was found that adults with disabilities were more likely to report that
the Internet had significantly improved the quality of their lives than those
without disabilities (48% vs. 27%). Adults with disabilities were also more
likely than those without disabilities to report that the Internet helped them
to be better informed about the world (52% vs. 39%), feel connected to the
world (44% vs. 38%), and reach out to people with similar interests and
experiences (44% vs 38%).  This reported impact on individuals with
disabilities underscores the importance of ensuring Web accessibility to all,
regardless of disability.  Internet access may help to counteract the findings
of another Harris poll that found that individuals with disabilities were more
likely to feel isolated, felt left out of their communities, and expressed a
desire to participate more (Taylor, 2000b). These results further emphasize the
importance of ensuring accessibility to all, regardless of disability.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>As the World Wide Web is becoming increasingly important,
businesses are also becoming increasingly network intensive, both internally
(intranets) and externally (Internet) (Schrage, 2000). A cross-sectional survey
of 248 executives from larger companies was recently performed by Towers Perrin
(2001). They found that 86% saw the Internet as changing business practices and
processes. Nearly half (48%) expect that the Internet will result in a
significant change, while one in five (20%) saw it as a “truly transformational
event that will completely change business models over the next 10-15 years.” 
The Web’s influence in this area is not limited to large businesses. A survey
performed at the Harvard Business School (Kanter, 2001) found that small (fewer
than 100 employees) and medium (100-500 employees) businesses actually matched
or outpaced larger businesses in the use of the Internet for internal
operations such as training and receiving employee feedback. At least a third
of all companies surveyed used the Web for each of the purposes asked about in
the survey, ranging from attracting new customers, to purchasing, to conducting
online meetings. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Given these predictions and expectations, what effects
will this “transformational event” known as the Internet have on employees,
specifically those with disabilities? The impact of the Internet will likely
depend on the type and nature of the person’s disability. For those with
mobility related impairments, many of these technologies may be greatly
enabling, allowing easy access to information at their computer. However, these
“cutting edge” Web applications also have the potential to be significant
barriers for those who have vision impairments, hearing problems, or limited
dexterity for mousing/navigating, unless the applications are designed to be
accessible.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The following is a list from the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C), whose mission focuses on making the Web more accessible, which describes
some of the barriers the Internet can present to people with different kinds of
disabilities (Brewer, 2001, p.5): </p>

      materials </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>flickering or strobing
      designs on pages</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoBodyText>There are a variety of evaluation tools that can be used
to find these barriers and determine how accessible Web sites are. Two of the
most commonly used evaluation tools are: BOBBY (http://www.cast.org/bobby/)
developed by the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) and WAVE
(http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/), developed by Pennsylvania’s Initiative on Assistive Technology (PIAT) at Temple University.  Another
tool is A-Prompt (Accessibility Prompt), developed jointly by the University of Toronto and the University of Wisconsin (http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/). 
These tools use the W3C’s Web content accessibility guidelines
(http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/) to determine if the site being evaluated is
accessible.  There are a variety of commercial products available as well that
are designed to assist Web developers build accessible Web sites (see
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html for a comprehensive list).  These
tools examine Web sites for specific accessibility problems and flag them. 
Some of the more advanced versions suggest solutions to correct the problem. As
noted by several studies utilizing the most popular evaluation engine Bobby, no
automatic checker is infallible and all require further manual checks to ensure
accessibility (Sams and Yates-Mercer, 2000, Jackson-Sanborn, Odess-Harnish and
Warren, 2001, Schmetzke, 2000)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>How accessible are Web sites?  Although there is a great
deal of literature on how to make Web sites accessible, there are few published
studies evaluating the accessibility of existing sites. The few studies of
post-secondary distance education sites are described in detail in the
e-learning section of this report that follows. At best, only about half of the
sites studied were found to be accessible (Sams and Yates-Mercer, 2000). A
recent study examined the accessibility of over 1,800 state and federal
government Web sites, and found that 17% met standards of accessibility. These
standards included either Bobby approval (5%), W3C or section 508 compliant
(4%), or had a text version available or text labels for their graphical images
(8%) (West, 2001). Regarding commercial sites, Heller (2001) states that very
few companies have made their Web sites accessible, or have even considered it,
primarily due to concerns about the expense of doing so. This despite the fact
that making a site accessible is estimated to run about one to two percent of
the entire site cost, according to Kynn Bartlett, the director of the HTML
Writers Guild’s accessible Web Authoring Resources and Education Center
(Heller, 2001).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>One of the most comprehensive studies to date of Web
accessibility examined the 50-100 most visited Web sites in six categories:
overall most visited, clothing, international, jobs, college (Jackson-Sanborn,
Odess-Harnish and Warren, 2001). The sixth category was a random sample of 295
government sites.  Bobby v3.2 was used to evaluate the first layer of each of
these sites. The results only discussed Bobby’s most basic priority 1 level
errors, “show stoppers” that could prevent individuals with various
disabilities from being able to access information on the site. The percentage
of sites that passed without Bobby’s priority 1 error flags was 33%; overall two
thirds (66%) of the Web sites failed Bobby’s most basic accessibility tests.
The government sites performed the best, with 60% passing without these
errors.  Interestingly, 85% of the 100 overall most popular sites on the Web
were found to have priority 1 accessibility errors.  Of particular interest for
this review is the fact that four out of five (81%) of the job sites were found
to be not accessible according to Bobby’s priority 1 criteria. Again, by far
the most common error found was the absence of alternative text for images (58%
of the sites). Only 6% of the sites passed Bobby’s more stringent user checks
level -- areas that may create accessibility problems that require manual
evaluation. It is important to note that the sites that trigger these user
checks do not necessarily mean they actually are inaccessible, only that Bobby
cannot automatically determine its effects.  The most common user check related
to whether color is used to convey information, to ensure that the information
is conveyed in an alternative and more accessible way as well. This is a
significant issue for the large population of those who experience
colorblindness.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574880">Legislation Relevant to Internet Accessibility</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Several major federal laws are applicable to Web
accessibility, including the ADA, Sections 501 and Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and in particular the following two pieces of
recent legislation:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:150%'>Section 508
     of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (1998), which requires Federal
     agencies’ electronic and information technology to be accessible to people
     with disabilities, including employees and members of the public (see
     www/section508.gov/docs/508law.html); and</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:150%'>Section 255
     of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , which requires manufacturers of
     telecommunications equipment and providers of telecommunications services
     to ensure that such equipment and services are accessible to persons with
     disabilities, if readily achievable. The Federal Communications
     Commission's Report and Order implementing Section 255 was released in
     September 1999 (see www/fcc.gov/telecom.html).</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoBodyText>These laws have begun to bring about improvements in
accessibility.  In 1999 the National Federation for the Blind (NFB) filed suit
against America Online Inc. based on the ADA’s equal access provisions.  NFB
used the ADA because AOL’s service was not compatible with screen reader
software used by the blind that translates text to speech.  The NFB dropped
their suit after AOL agreed to make its browser software compatible with the
screen reader software (Gibson, 2001).  In the wake of this suit the IRS’s
e-filing partners HDVest Inc., Intuit Inc., and H &amp; R Block have agreed to
make their sites accessible.  Some of the response to these lawsuits in the
popular business press has been quite negative, emphasizing potential liability
and frivolous lawsuits related to lack of accessibility (Frezza, 2000; Olson,
2000; and Schrage, 2000).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>With this backdrop of accessibility issues for people with
disabilities, we will now turn to the focus of this literature review, and the
use of the Internet for applications in the human resources process.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc152574881">Web Recruiting</a> </h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Recruiting qualified employees is vital for business
success. Recruiting on the Internet has become one of the primary ways that
companies attempt to find employees and the growth of this method has been
nothing short of amazing. In this section, we will discuss the current use of
online recruiting, the different forms Internet recruiting can take, and its
impact on employees and the hiring process. Interestingly, despite extensive
searches through the literature, the issue of accessibility only surfaced on a
few special niche sites designed to cater to individuals with disabilities.
Additionally, only one research study was found that examined the accessibility
of job sites – the first step towards employment in this world of the Internet.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574882">Current Use of Web Recruiting</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>With millions of jobs and résumés available online “The
Internet has become the most effective way to broadly disseminate information
about the availability of jobs and people” (How online recruiting changes the
hiring game, 2001). Bruce Hatz, a corporate staffing manager at
Hewlett-Packard, states “It’s dramatically more effective than any medium ever
known. The Web is the future of recruiting.” (Useem, 1999, p. 97).  Indeed,
research by Goldman Sachs showed that between the beginning of 1999 and
November 2000, traffic to career-oriented Web sites had more than doubled, to
12.3 million unique visitors per day (Rosenwald, 2000). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>According to Intel chairman Andy Grove, digital résumés,
digital employment advertising, and digital résumé searches are resulting in a
“rebuilding of the infrastructure,” and  “It’s almost following e-mail in its
growth” (Useem, 1999, p. 97). A July, 2001 poll of 400 recruiters by Recruiters
Network found that 78% felt Internet job postings were the most effective way
to spend job search budgets, far outstripping newspaper classifieds (12%) and
career fairs (7%) (Gill, 2001). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A January 2001 poll by the Society of Human Resource
Management (SHRM, 2001) supports these findings:  88% of the HR managers
surveyed reported using Internet job postings, just slightly behind the
proportion using personal contact/networking (95%), newspaper advertisements
(96%) and employee referrals (91%).  Internet job postings came in ahead of
headhunters (74%), employment agencies (76%), and advertisements in
professional and trade journals (67%). The survey also asked about the
effectiveness of these different recruiting methods. The majority (58%) of the
respondents said that Internet job postings were an effective or extremely
effective method of search techniques, just slightly less effective than the
highest rated “personal contact/networking” (61%).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A survey of 150 hiring executives in the 1,000 largest U.S. firms found that nearly half (48%) preferred to receive résumés by e-mail, a
significant change from 1998 when only 4% had this preference (OfficeTeam.com,
2000). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>According to a survey conducted last year by Yankelovich
Partners, over a 12-month period, one out of every ten new hires was a direct
result of online recruiting for the companies surveyed (Kforce, 2000). Dow
Chemical is going even further. They are no longer accepting paper résumés for
professional positions (estimated 1,500 people nationwide) and are recruiting
all new salaried workers from their pool of online candidates (Gill, 2001).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Job seekers themselves also have demonstrated a great
interest in the Internet. A 1998 study performed by J. Walter Thompson’s
Specialized Communications Group found that 70% of all active job seekers
preferred the Internet to other methods and that more than half the general
public planned to use the Internet to find their next job (Conhaim, 1998). The
Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) search tactics poll (2001) found
that 96% of job seekers surveyed had used Internet job postings to look for a
new job. While that is a very high percentage, it is also important to note
that the job seekers polled for this study had signed up for the
CareerJournal.com’s Job Alert list, and were therefore more likely to have used
online job searching than a random sample of job seekers.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574883">Recruiting Methods - Then and Now</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Traditionally, organizations used five primary methods of
attracting job applicants:  newspaper advertisements, word of mouth, campus
recruiting, trade organizations, and job fairs.  Recently, however, online
recruiting has made a significant impact on how many companies go about finding
new employees. The first online job site was established in 1994 by Jeff
Taylor, the founder of Monster.com (the 454th dot.com site). Job candidates
could post their résumés and search a database of job openings for free, while
employers paid for access to the résumé database and for the right to post job
openings. Over the past seven years online recruiting has ballooned into a
multi-billion dollar international phenomenon (Marron, 2001).  According to Kay
(2000), few markets have been hit as hard by the power of the Web and
e-commerce as the recruiting industry. A 1999 Forrester Research report
projected that companies would spend $1.7 billion on Internet recruiting by
2003.  Two years later, in their 2001 Electronic Recruiting Index, Interbiznet
predicted that $7.5 billion would be spent on Internet recruiting efforts in
2001.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Web recruiting typically takes two forms: job listings
posted by individual companies on their own Web sites; or job listings on third
party sites or job boards, where employers pay to post their positions and to
search the résumé database for candidates.  In either case, job postings can
be  searched for free by potential candidates to identify positions that might
be of interest and appropriate for their skills. Many company career sites
allow applicants to submit their résumés online and take virtual tours of the
company via the Web site. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Why this interest in online recruiting? A recent survey of
311 HR professionals and 244 professional search organizations by Hunt-Scanlon
(a firm that provides information to the recruiting industry) asked why they
choose to recruit on the Internet. The most common answers included: expanding
the potential pool of applicants, lower cost of posting the opening, absence of
a middleman, and greater convenience and speed (Kay, 2000). At high tech firms
such as Microsoft, Sun Microsystems and Unisys, online recruiting has become
the second-highest source of new hires after employee referral programs
(McCool, 2000). Cost savings can be significant; according to the Employment
Management Association the cost per hire with traditional advertising is $3,295
vs. $377 using online recruiting (Lightly, 2000). PricewaterhouseCoopers has
reduced its cost per hire from $23,000 (including headhunter fees) to $280
though the use of the Web, and now finds 90% of its hires through the Internet
(Muoio, 2000). Cisco Systems receives 81% of its résumés and hires 66% of its
new employees over the Web. Its cost per hire is 39% lower than the industry
average, a savings of over $4,000 per employee (Useem, 1999). These cost
savings are due to a combination of factors, including the lower costs of
advertising online ($200) vs. traditional print advertising ($1,500+), and
removing the headhunter’s cut (typically 20% to 35% of the new hire’s base
salary). Sutter Health claims to have cut their paperwork related to recruiting
in half (White, 2001).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Time is of the essence in the e-recruiting world.
According to a study by Recruitsoft.com, “the life expectancy of a hot résumé
now is 72 hours” (McCool, 2000). The potential speed of getting an employee on
board can have a significant effect on a company’s bottom line, by minimizing
the productivity loss related to an unfilled position. An iLogos study found
that using the Web takes 20 days off the hiring cycle on average. Cisco systems
cut their time to fill a job opening by over half, from 113 days three years
ago to 45 days (Useem, 1999).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Internet recruiting has also improved the ability of
smaller companies to find and attract talented employees; this was previously
only possible for larger companies. A survey of HR executives commissioned by
Kforce.com, a Internet recruiting company, found that nearly 60% of respondents
from small companies said they now competed with large companies for talent,
thanks to e-recruiting (More Pros and Cons to Internet Recruiting, 2000).</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574884">Job Boards</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>   Monster.com was the pioneer in job boards, but now,
less than seven years later, there are over 28,500 Web sites vying for employer
job postings and résumés. Some, such as Monster.com and JobsOnline.com, are
“all around” sites that list a huge variety of positions. Others are “niche”
sites focused on specific types of jobs, applicants or geographic areas. These
include IT Workers (Dice.com), healthcare workers (medimorphus.com), hotel
employment (SOShotels.com, hcareers.com), and even morticians (funeralnet.com).
ExBigFive.com focuses on candidates with specific consulting backgrounds
(Swanson, 2000).  There are also sites designed for employers looking for
recent college graduates who are seeking jobs (jobtrak.com).  Recently a
bilingual site opened specifically designed to serve those of Hispanic origin
and employers in need of Spanish speaking or bilingual employees (saludos.com).
As the demographics of the available workforce change, job boards are trying to
stay ahead of the curve. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A relatively new development in the online job arena is
the idea of “diversity sites.” These enable employers who are looking to
increase their diversity to perform a more focused search. Many of these are
not-for-profit sites that “specialize” in certain minorities, such as Black
Collegians Online (black-collegian.com), U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce
(jobcentro.com), American Association of Hispanic Certified Accountants
(hispanic-cpa.org), and Native Americans (NativeWeb.com). There are also
several job boards targeted towards people with disabilities, including the
National Business and Disability Council (business-disability.com),
handiworkonline.com, hirepotential.com, jobaccess.org , and justonebreak.com.  </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>FlipDog.com (recently acquired by Monster.com) takes yet
another approach to job postings by trolling the sites of over 50,000 large and
small employers and gathering them into one source. The site includes job
searching capabilities and career advice.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Hard numbers regarding the recruiting field are difficult
to come by, but everyone agrees that business is growing very quickly, and so
far significantly faster than even very optimistic predictions had expected. A
yearly report entitled “Electronic Recruiting Index,” published by interbiz.com
(an Internet business consulting firm), generates a revenue projection through
2005. In their 1999 report they predicted that the year 2000 revenues from job
postings would be $1.45 billion. In 2001 they reported $3.25 billion of revenue
in the year 2000, more than twice the predicted growth. Interbiznet.com
predicts job boards will generate over $16 billion on posting fees alone in the
year 2005 (interbiznet.com, 2001). The Massachusetts based International Data
Corp. predicts that the worldwide e-recruiting market will reach $13.4 billion
by 2005 (Marron, 2001).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>According to a press release dated May 14, 2001,
Monster.com, still the largest job board, claims to lead the industry with a
53% market share in terms of site visits (Goodridge, 2001), has over 10 million
résumés in its résumé bank, and lists over 450,000 positions. Its clients
include 90 of the Fortune 100, and 480 of the Fortune 500 companies (Richardson, 2000). In April 2001 Monster.com had 5.7 million unique visitors to its Web
site (up 63% from the previous year) and they stayed an average of 36 minutes
at the site, while clicking on an average of 28 pages per visit (White, 2001).
It was estimated that 6.6% of the total Internet population accessed
Monster.com in the month of April 2001 (Monster.com, 2001).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Almost all job boards offer job searching and résumé
posting for job seekers, but many are going beyond those basic services in an
attempt to differentiate themselves from the competition.  Most sites offer
additional resources as enticement to both job seekers and employers. Such
information includes how to create a successful résumé, salary calculators,
career planners and company profiles for job seekers.  Examples of additional
services offered by job boards, both for applicants and employers, are listed
below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Services for applicants:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Job Agents -- a searcher
     identifies the type of job in which they are interested and the Agent
     e-mails the individual when a match is found.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Résumé builders, which allow an
     applicant to either paste their résumé in or build it online.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Confidential career services,
     which allow applicants to apply anonymously, protecting their identity
     from their current employer.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Q &amp; A areas where a job
     seeker can post questions or search a database for similar issues.
     Techies.com is even considering a mentoring service that would match up
     experienced IT professionals with new Techies.com members (Online job
     sites try to stand out from a crowd, 2000).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Metasearch capabilities, which
     allow the job seeker to extend their search beyond the primary job board’s
     internal job boards to include jobs located at other sites.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Services offered for employers:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Web-Based Applicant Tracking
     Programs, which allow companies to track applicants as they move through
     the recruitment process, and enable HR departments to evaluate their
     process. Some applicant tracking programs are designed to “keep tabs” on
     quality applicants that take a position with a different company (in case
     they change their minds).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>One Stop Service -- some job
     boards, such as CareerSite.com can automatically “cross post” positions to
     other job boards for additional exposure. The service can remove the
     position when it has been filled or expired from all the job boards
     automatically.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Online “interviews” allow hiring
     managers to customize a set of “screening” questions for online applicants
     to answer (Murphy, 2000).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Phone interviews of promising
     candidates by professional recruiters prior to sending them on to a

 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Additional information for
     employers such as how to create effective job postings, ways of luring IT
     talent, average sign-on bonuses for employers, etc.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Metasearch capabilities, which
     allow the employer to extend their search beyond the primary job board’s

</ul>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574885">Individual Company Use of Recruiting Sites</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A study of online job seeker behavior by iLogos (a
research division of Recruitsoft) found that the vast majority of corporate
career Web site visitors came directly to the site and were not funneled in by
way of a job board. Of those visitors 72% are employed and 21 percent are
happily employed. Nearly half of the happily employed came from somewhere else
on the corporate Web site (iLogos, 2001).  This study suggests that companies
would be well advised to enable visitors to browse and apply for positions at
the corporate Web site and make the company attractive to both “passive” and
active job seekers encouraging them to explore possible employment
opportunities.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Many companies are now creating dedicated job sites on
their corporate Web sites in addition to posting positions on job boards. A
study performed by iLogos of the global 500 (500 largest companies in the world
based on gross revenue, compiled by Fortune magazine). They found that
corporate Web site recruiting has ballooned in these large companies: from only
29% in 1998 to 88% in 2001. Fully 93% of the US based global 500 companies are
currently actively recruiting on their corporate Web sites. Significant growth over
the past year has occurred in Europe (73% in 2000 to 83% in 2001) and
Asia/Pacific (68% to 88%). The following list shows the proportion of Global
500 companies using their corporate Web site for recruiting by industry (iLogos
Research, 2001):</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>100% of companies in the
     Healthcare* sector</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>97% of companies in the
     Manufacturing sector</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>96% of companies in the
     Transportation* sector</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>89% of companies in the High Tech
     sector</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>87% of companies in the Consumer
     sector</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>83% of companies in the Natural
     Resources sector</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>82% of companies in the Financial
     sector</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>82% of companies in the
     Wholesale* sector</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>79% of companies in the
     Utilities* sector</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>*denotes small sample size </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Although a few of the sectors had small sample sizes,
leading to less accurate estimates of that sector, it is evident that corporate
Website recruiting is no longer restricted to the high tech sector.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Small companies are also getting into corporate Web site
recruiting with the assistance of online recruiting firms. Jobnet.com has a new
technology that allows small to medium employers to easily create a career site
on their own Website in just a few minutes for a minimal cost ($1 for a job
posting and $.25 for each résumé collected). This site is actually hosted and
maintained by Jobnet, but exists on the company’s Website, allowing them to
compete with the larger firms. CareerSite.com also has a similar offering. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>According to a press release by JobTrak.com (now part of
Monster.com), corporate Web sites have become the primary means students use to
research companies and evaluate career opportunities, replacing company
brochures and annual reports. A poll of college students taken by JobTrak.com
(2000) found that over three-quarters (79%) of those polled said the quality of
an employer’s Website was important in their decision of whether or not to
apply for a job; of these, 44% said it was very important. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A study by iLogos Research outlined the “Best Practices
for Fortune 500 Career Web Site Recruiting” to attract, convince, and process
jobseekers via the Web  (Ilogos Research, 2000). Some of the best practices
include: linking the careers section directly from their Web site homepage; the
ability to apply for a job with a single click; including information on
corporate culture and on benefits; maintaining a searchable database of open
positions; and offering a separate college recruiting section. Other
recommended features include: a résumé builder, cutting and pasting of résumés,
“Email to a friend” option (adding the potential for personal networking), job
agents that automatically notify candidates of matching positions, allowing
anonymous applications for those concerned with privacy issues, and candidate
profiling to speed applicant processing. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574886">Other Effects on Employers and Applicants</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Even with all the new services available, Internet
recruiting and job boards can be a mixed blessing for both employers and
applicants.  One of the interesting “side effects” of e-recruiting is a change
in the relationship and balance of power between the organization and the
candidate. Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School, suggests that online recruiting levels the playing field between employees and
employers (How online recruiting changes the hiring game, 2001). Toni
Langlinais, a consulting partner in Andersen Consulting, goes a step further
and states “We are seeing a fundamental shift driven by the Internet from a
seller-driven world to a buyer-driven world – and the onset of a new
battlefield between business models” (Piturro, 2000). The ability to “passively
job hunt” (placing a résumé online and see who “bites”) is expected to erode
employee loyalty, especially for those with the most desirable job skills.
Since there is no cost to e-mail a résumé, e-recruiting allows employees to
always have their résumés in play for the any better offer that may come along.
Employees can easily check out the competition’s employment site, see what’s
available, e-mail a résumé, and have the company get back to them when an
opportunity arises. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Despite this more level playing field, a survey by the
Society for Human Resource Management found that job seekers are not completely
satisfied, with less than half (48%) saying that Internet job postings are
effective (SHRM, 2001). However, these same job seekers rated Internet job
postings as third most effective behind personal contact/networking  (78%) and
employee referrals (65%).  Internet job postings were rated as more effective
than many traditional methods, including headhunters (45%), employment agencies
(31%), newspaper ads (30%), and job fairs (23%) (SHRM, 2001).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>For employers, access may be easier and faster, and
smaller companies may be able to compete with larger corporations, but online résumés
do come with a price.  Due to the combination of extended reach of Web
recruiting and the ease of applying, HR departments can find themselves
overwhelmed with applicants. In order to get the best applicant for the
position, they must process all résumés submitted as quickly as possible. For
example, Sutter Health found themselves inundated by 300,000 résumés a year,
which often took weeks for the HR affiliates to work through (Seminerio, 2001).
Once a résumé is submitted electronically by a candidate it is processed and
deposited into a central database. In many larger companies even paper résumés
are scanned into the database. Hewlett-Packard (H-P) has even developed
technology to process résumés in a variety of languages, including Asian
characters. H-P’s résumé database contains over 150,000 résumés (Useem, 1999).
The electronic résumé database allows HR to search for candidates whose résumés
contain specific terms or certain combination of terms such as “manager” and
“C++.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>To further help corporate Human Resource professionals
deal with the flood of résumés, certain vendors and companies are offering a
new line of services.  They have developed software that automatically
evaluates, ranks and matches candidates with openings, using sophisticated data
mining and filtering techniques. Sutter Health uses Recruitsoft Inc., an
application service provider, or ASP, to perform this task, and has reduced
their recruiting process time from weeks to days (Seminerio, 2001).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Another technique that is becoming available to assist HR
in handling the résumé flood is Web based questionnaires/skill tests.
Applicants are queried regarding specific skills and experience that are
required for the position, and candidates are then automatically ranked on the
basis of those qualifications (Martinez, 2001). Some of the more sophisticated
programs, such as that available from Recruitsoft, will even automatically
shift candidates from the job they applied for to one that they may be better
qualified for (Seminerio, 2001) based on their test results.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Résumé evaluation software is actually driving a change in
what makes a successful résumé. Traditional résumés are action verb oriented,
and use bold and italicized lettering for emphasis. In contrast, electronically
submitted résumés must include terms and acronyms specific to the employing industry,
and terms for which employers will likely search (Hodowanes, 2000). Any special
formatting used in a paper résumé is lost in an electronic document and may
actually interfere with a search engine’s ability to search the document.
Chronological order has been replaced by “knowledge, skills and abilities,”
with those most sought after being listed close to the top of the résumé to
improve the number of search engine “hits”(Useem, 1999). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>One network engineer described how his first résumé
submitted to Monster.com only produced a few responses. After exploring the résumé
preparation guides offered by Monster.com, he restructured his résumé
emphasizing his experience with some major companies.  Within a span of four
days he was inundated with calls from dozens of companies (Ruber, 2000). Some
savvy applicants are including a keyword section in their résumé to improve the
chances of the search engine catching them.  On the downside, some less
scrupulous applicants include terms such as C++ or Java just to get the
attention of search engines, while some employers may include such terms in
their job descriptions in the hope that they will attract better candidates
even if the skills aren’t central to the position (Ruber, 2000). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Web recruiting technology offers great potential to many
job applicants, especially those who may have a disability that reduces their
mobility, as the job search can take place at their own computer. On the other
hand it raises a concern regarding access, as minorities and people with
disabilities are less likely to have a computer and Internet access (Kaye,
2000).  According to research noted earlier (Jackson-Sanborn, Odess-Harnish and
  Warren, 2001) only 18% of the 100 most heavily trafficked recruiting Web
sites were found to be accessible according to Bobby level 1 priorities. Given
these results, inaccessible Web based recruiting presents a significant
employment roadblock for those who have disabilities that prevent them from
using a primarily visually oriented, point and click environment. </p>

<h1><a name="_Toc152574887">E-Benefits</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Benefits is another Human Resource area that is rapidly
becoming Web-based. The Web allows employees easy access to information, and
communication by the company is also simplified – assuming the designers of the
site considered accessibility. Accessibility for employees with disabilities
was never mentioned in any of the literature reviewed. The following section
will describe the use of the Inter/intranet in the benefits process, the extent
of its use, growth predictions, and some specific examples of E-benefits use
and impact in the literature.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574888">Benefits Self-Service</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>According to a 2000 survey by The Hunter Group, an
international consulting firm based in Baltimore, Internet/intranet based
systems, which allow employees to see and manage their own information about
benefits, payroll deductions and career changes 24/7, are revolutionizing HR
functions (Wells, 2001). They found that over 90 percent of the 342 companies
surveyed reported “successful or somewhat successful” self-service systems, as
measured by improvements in employee satisfaction and the rapid return on
investment.  The survey found that the average company spent $1.5 million on
employee self-service systems. The per-employee cost was found to vary widely,
from $35 to $1,500, depending on company size and offerings.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>This use of the Web for benefits self-service is becoming
more popular due to improved efficiency and speed. The following are some of
the more common transactions employees can perform utilizing Web based E-benefits:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Personal data maintenance</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Employee communication</li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Family status changes</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Access to “Elective” benefits </li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Towers Perrin, a management and HR consulting firm, has
performed an annual survey for the past four years of nearly 100 leading
companies examining HR service centers. The participants represent a variety of
industries in the U.S. including: manufacturing/industrial (29%), energy
companies (10%), consumer products (12%), health care (13%), financial services
(18%), other (19%) (Towers Perrin, 2001). In their most recently published
study (2001) Towers Perrin found that 91% of the firms surveyed offer employees
access to their HR Website at work and nearly half (49%) allow access from home
(up from 83% and 31% in 2000). Over half (60%) of the firms allow online
benefit enrollment, almost double that found the previous year. Just over the
past two years, the growth in the services available has been significant, as
demonstrated by the numbers below:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:0in'></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:0in'>The majority of those who had not
implemented these transactions as of 2001 planned to do so within the next
year.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Towers Perrin study also examined three issues that
relate to workplace changes due to online HR. Virtually all reported a
significant increase in timeliness of transactions, with more than 70%
reporting significant improvements in the accuracy of information. Fewer
reported significant reductions in HR workload.  It appears that employees
utilize the online systems to address their basic questions, while the HR
representatives are fielding more specific questions and fewer basic queries. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>   In a recent survey performed by Watson Wyatt (2000),
79% of companies surveyed chose the company intranet as their primary method of
delivering HR–related services to employees, with the Internet coming in a
close second at 70%. This represented a huge increase from the 50% of companies
using the Web just two years ago. Results of this survey found to be focused on
improving HR service and communication with employees. Satisfaction with these
technologies was quite high, with 80% reporting the intranet method as being
moderately to very effective and 69% reporting the same for their use of the
Internet. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Larger companies most often used a combination of their
company’s intranet (85%), the Internet (72%), interactive voice response
systems (63%), and call centers (43%) to perform human resource service
delivery. Interestingly, smaller firms were most likely to use the company
intranet (74%) and public Internet (68%) for HR service delivery (Wells, 2001).
This may be a result of the improved efficiency of a Web-based process,
requiring fewer people to provide service delivery. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Most of the studies mentioned above focused primarily on
larger companies, but third party service providers have recently begun
offering to deliver similar benefits via extranets to smaller companies as
well, such as work/life services (Frost, 1998; Cohen, 2000). This allows small
companies to offer such benefits as dependent care accounts and 401K plans,
along with 24/7 access to information that they typically could not provide
internally. Forrester Research recently found that 32% of employers surveyed
use the Internet for benefits administration and an additional 54% plan to go
that route within the next five years (Elswick, 2001).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>There are numerous examples of companies that have moved
towards this online-based process. With 80,000 employees in 150 countries,
Canada-based Nortel now does all benefits enrollment online. Nortel estimates
that just five percent of the workforce signs up for benefits on paper (Wells,
2001). Many online systems allow employees to get the most out of their benefit
plans by offering products and services along with objective tools to assist
them in their planning (Mitchell, 2000). IBM designed an interactive question
and answer “plan finder” located on their intranet. This tool uses data and
choices supplied by the employee, weighs the merits of different plans based on
a variety of criteria (such as cost, coverage, customer service and
performance), and returns a view of preferred plans ranked and graphed. As of
last year, more than 80% of IBM’s 140,000 Armonk, New York employees enrolled
online (Wells, 2001). According to IBM’s manager of HR e-business solutions,
the previous paper-based process was so confusing that it could take days for
the employee to figure out what to do (Greengard, 2000). This Web based
paperless system also saved IBM an estimated $1 million in costs related to the
delivery of benefits information.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574889">“Elective” Benefits and Knowledgebase Systems</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>“Elective” benefits are also increasingly popular
offerings by companies. These benefits can include a wide variety of products
and services such as life stages education, personalized retirement and
financial planning, insurance and a variety of banking products including
mortgages, checking credit cards and discount brokerage (Mitchell, 2000). These
benefits may be offered by external providers through a Web “portal” such as
RewardsPlus.com, which allows an employee to not only file medical claims and
other standard benefit transactions but also gives access to non-traditional
“niche” services such as real estate referrals, car insurance quotes, and pet
service discounts.  </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>One of the latest advances in HR technology is the
knowledgebase system. Knowledgebase technology allows HR to consolidate all
information they make available to employees into a central online database.
Almost 60% of the companies surveyed in the 2001 Towers Perrin survey use
knowledgebase technology. IBM has developed a knowledgebase system that
contains more than 500 “data elements” related to each of its 140,000 employees
(Greengard, 2000). When linked with the employee self service system, it can
allow employees to receive personalized information tailored specifically for
them, based on their HR information in the system.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>At least three-quarters of employees of the companies
participating in the Towers Perrin (2000) survey had access to the Web. How can
the 25% without computer access benefit from these new technologies? Some
companies are taking steps to ensure shop-floor workers and other employees
without desktop computer access opportunities to access their information as
well. For example, the Hard Rock Café International has touch-screen kiosks in
the break room of each of its 45 U.S. restaurants. Schlumberger Ltd, a global
oilfield services and technology testing company, has 60 kiosks at its
manufacturing centers (Communicating benefits information online, 2001). Intel
also makes public kiosks or terminals available to factory workers who don’t
have computers on their desks (Roberts, 1999). According to a 1999 study by the
marketing and training firm Frost and Sullivan, the interactive kiosk market is
expected to grow to nearly $3 billion dollars by 2003 (Communicating benefits
information online, 2001). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>As the Hunter Group suggests, E-benefits and self-service
are revolutionizing HR by improving their ability to provide and communicate
information to their employees. If the pace of growth continues as it has for
the past three years it will rapidly become as ubiquitous as the Web itself. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>As with E-recruiting, E-benefits have the potential to be
either a great boon to employees with disabilities or a significant barrier,
depending on the type of disability and the accessibility of the benefits
system.  An inaccessible benefits system would disadvantage employees with
certain disabilities, denying them the easy access to information, updates, or
the special elective benefits or “Plan finder” tools enjoyed by other
employees. On the other hand, having benefits information and the ability to
enroll on-line on their own computer at any time could be a significant
advantage for employees with mobility impairments. Knowledgebase systems and
“Plan finders” (interactive Q&amp;A tools) could simplify the decision making
process for individuals with cognitive or psychological disabilities. If the
interface and information are designed to be accessible for screen reader use,
visually disabled employees would have access to updated benefits information
at the same time as employees without disabilities, avoiding any delay as
materials are converted to audio, large print, or Braille.  However, as noted
above, if E-benefits are not accessible, they may present a new E-barrier for
employees with disabilities in the workplace. </p>

<h1><a name="_Toc152574890">Online Training</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Online training has been becoming increasingly popular
over the past several years, due in part to its potential for cost savings and
convenience of 24/7 access. This section will focus on online training -
specifically on corporate use of the technology. Trends in the use of online
training in the literature will be explored, including who is using it and for
what purposes. The few studies found that have examined the accessibility of
such training technologies are also reviewed.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574891">E-Training</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>   The Commission on Technology and Adult Learning report:
A Vision of E-Learning for America’s Workforce (2001) has this to say about
E-training:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>E-learning has
the potential to revolutionize the basic tenets of learning by making it
individual - rather than institution-based, eliminating clock-hour measures in
favor of performance and outcome measures, and emphasizing customized learning
solutions over generic, one-size-fits-all instruction. It is this
transformational potential of e-learning that the Commission believes America must recognize and embrace in the years ahead (pg. 4).</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574892">Corporate Employee Training</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>   According to Employee Benefit News, corporate employee
training has become an integral contributor to business success (Elswick,
2001). In the year 2000, U.S. companies budgeted $54 billion for employee
training (Training Magazine Staff, 2000). Corporate training typically
encompasses the following general categories: management/supervisory skills,
communication skills, technical skills, customer service, executive
development, sales, and computer applications.  A study by
PricewaterhouseCoopers found that nearly three quarters (70%) of the world’s
largest companies cited the lack of trained employees as the number one barrier
to sustaining growth (Stacey, 2000). The speed at which knowledge and skills
are becoming obsolete is also pushing training to the fore. According to
Margaret Driscol, Director of Strategy for IBM’s MindSpan Solutions “fifty–five
percent of employees’ skills are outdated in three to five years” (Elswick,
2001). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In 1999, three-quarters of corporate training was
instructor-led; however, instructor-led training is one of the most expensive
types of training to provide. It is estimated that two-thirds of the costs of
training are allotted to travel related expenses - getting the employees to the
classroom. Another significant “hidden” cost includes lost employee
productivity while traveling to the training site. In an attempt to reduce
training costs, many companies have been exploring other methods beyond
traditional classroom/instructor based training. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A Forrester Research study confirmed the importance of
cost savings, finding that 79% of companies interviewed identified it as a
reason for adopting online training. The savings can be significant – IBM saved
more than $80 million in travel and housing expenses in 1999 alone by using
online training across its worldwide operations (Murray, 2001).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The most rapidly growing alternative training method is
referred to as technology-based learning. Technology-based learning includes:
audio/video tape, satellite broadcast, interactive TV, CD-ROM and online via
Internet or intranet. In 1999 technology based learning accounted for 20% of
corporate learning and is expected to account for 40% by 2003 (Corporate
University Xchange, 1999). International Data Corporation (IDC), technology and
e-business consultants, predict that corporations will spend $14.5 billion on
e-training by 2004 (up from nothing in 1997). Within e-learning, IDC has
determined that online training is the fastest growing of all the e-learning
mediums – increasing at 83% per year (Urdan and Weggen, 2000).  As with many
Internet predictions, numbers vary, but virtually all predict significant
growth over the next few years.  Urdan and Weggen (2000) predict that online
training will be the hottest trend in corporate training and expect it to climb
to $11.4 billion by 2003, while Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation predicts
a $40 billion market by 2005 (Rosenbaum, 2001).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>An industry survey performed by Training Magazine found
that over 70% of the largest companies (10,000+) used online training, and
almost half (47%) of the smaller companies (100-499) used this method as well
(Training Magazine Staff, 2000). Online-based training was only exceeded by
traditional classes (97%) and videotapes (79%). Overall, 13% of corporate training
is delivered by computer alone, with an additional 6% using a combination of
online programs and a remote instructor. Fully half of the computerized
instruction is network-based, with 31% delivered via internal “intranet,” and
an additional 19% by the Internet (40% by CD-ROM ). The majority of online
training is in the form of tutorials; however Training Magazine found that
nearly a third (29%) of online training is based on a classroom model, allowing
interaction between the instructor and/or other students. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574893">Benefits and Drawbacks of Online Training</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The rapid growth of online training is a result of its
many benefits.  There are also, however, some inherent drawbacks.  A summary of
these, drawn from the literature, is presented below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some benefits of online training:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Flexibility –  it is relatively
     easy to refine/adjust the training if needed</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Consistency – no variation
     between trainings caused by individual instructors</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Unlike traditional training, per

 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>24/7 access</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Training can be offered in 10-30

 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Self paced – allowing students to
     move back and forth to review material</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Avoids “knowledge lag”— since
     online training is not limited geographically, all employees can be
     trained at the same time rather than experiencing delays as a traditional
     class is “rolled out” across locations</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>“Just-in-time/learning on demand”
     – quick tutorials can be available on an “as needed” basis</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Student progress can be easily
     tracked</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some drawbacks of online training:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Initial development cost can be
     high</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Less interaction (or none) with
     instructor or fellow students and subsequent loss of learning from this
     interaction</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Students must be self-motivated</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Requires a minimum level of computer
     literacy </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Comfort level with online
     training can be a problem</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Minimum computer requirements (i.e.
     CPU speed, download speed of pages) may require updating older office
     equipment</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574894">Types of Training Offered</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The first use of online training was for IT training,
focusing on teaching desktop applications, networking, and Internet skills.
Recently, training in non-IT areas such as management, finance, employee
orientation, product information, and customer relations skills has been
growing at a compound annual rate of 123%, nearly twice the rate of IT training
at 65% (Urden &amp; Weggen., 2000). According to Training Magazine (2000), 45%
of computer delivered corporate training was in these non-IT areas.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>As with E-recruiting, larger firms often produce their own
E-training programs for internal use. However, there are also a number of third
party vendors that make E-learning programs available to small and medium sized
companies. TrainingSupersite.com lists nearly 1,000 companies offering some
sort of online e-training. IT industry leaders often offer E-training for their
products, including HP, IBM, Oracle and Cisco Systems (Kelly, 2001).
Traditional educational institutions are also getting into online corporate
training, including collaborations such as that between New York University (NYUonline) and McGraw-Hill Higher Education (Corporate University Review, 2000).</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574895">Forms of Online Training</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>There are three basic forms of online learning, and many
classes combine several of the methods (Ryan, 2001).  These are as follows:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Self-paced independent study</i>
     – The trainee sets the schedule and the pace and can review material as
     much as is needed. Online quizzes provide automatic pre-programmed
     feedback. This type of learning requires the most motivation and no one is
     available to answer questions that the student may have.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Asynchronous interactive</i> –
     Trainees participate with an instructor and other students but not
     necessarily at the same time. This method allows support and feedback from
     instructor and fellow participants but not as self-paced as an independent
     study.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Synchronous learning</i> –
     Trainee attends live lectures via computer and can ask questions by e-mail
     or real-time chat. This is most like a traditional classroom with the
     lecture format and interactive element, but also the most expensive and
     least flexible format of the three.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574896">Current Users of Online Training</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A wide variety of firms use E-training. According to Masie
Center, a technology and learning think tank, 92% of large organizations
implemented some form of online learning in 1999 (Terry, 2000).  A Training
Magazine study found very little variation by type of industry or company size
and their use of online training (Training Magazine Staff, 2000). Some specific
examples of larger entities using of online training are: </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>The fast food giant McDonald’s
     piloted an e-learning program in five different languages, with plans to
     standardize training across its 28,000 restaurants in 120 countries
     (Martin, 2001).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>The hotel chain Days Inn has
     developed interactive Web-based training for its 18,000 employees in 1,800
     locations to help deal with its constant need to train new employees
     (Roberts, 1998).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:150%'>IBM has moved
     almost all of its first three phases of management training for first line
     managers to online training. According to a study by Brandon-Hall, IBM now
     offers five times the training content prior to E-learning at one-third
     the cost, at an annual savings of $200 million (Verespej, 2001).</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The federal sector has also moved into E-training in a big
way. The Army plans to spend about $500 million over the next five years
providing laptops and offering distance education to all of its soldiers
through universities and distance learning corporations (Carr, 2000). The Army
hopes to improve its ability to recruit, train and retain technically savvy
“employees” by offering its soldiers an opportunity to earn technical
certification or an associate’s, bachelor’s, or master’s degree (Seffers,
2001). The IRS determined that 78% of its $100M training budget was
travel-related expenses. The agency decided that implementing an e-learning
program could save money and be more efficient by allowing employees to train
at their desks, speeding the agency’s reorganization and modernization program
(Hasson, 2001).</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152574897">Online Learning and Accessibility</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>   A recent Web based survey performed by the European
Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP, 2001) focused
specifically on E-learning for people with disabilities. Ninety percent of the
320 respondents were European respondents, with approximately half from the
public sector, 30% from the private sector and 17% from the disability field.
It must be noted that the respondents were not a random or representative
sample but rather those “interested/motivated” to participate; however, the
results are still of interest. Over half (55%) agreed that “E-learning will
open up new and innovative learning opportunities for communities of learners
with disabilities,” and four out of five believed that E-learning should be
provided to improve equality of access. Over a quarter of respondents “always
have some learners with disabilities and have standard arrangements in place,”
while an additional 37% said they made arrangements on an ad hoc basis. Only
23% said they never had learners with disabilities or they had learners with
disabilities but made no special arrangements. Between 46% and 66% of
participants considered E-learning suitable for learners with sight, hearing,
speech, motion and learning disabilities. Interestingly, the highest percentage
(66%) was for those with hearing disabilities and the lowest (46%) with sight
disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The respondents to the study were also asked about the
accessibility needs of their students: Nearly a third (32.5%) reported their
learners required visual assistance (from glasses to Braille) and another third
(31.6%) required hearing aids or signing (CEDEFOP, 2001). About 23% require
voice or speech technologies to communicate with IT technology and an
additional 28% require other technologies to assist with the physical
manipulation of information. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Only a few studies have attempted to evaluate the
accessibility of online training/education sites. Those that have been
performed have primarily focused on post-secondary distance education sites,
and have found the majority of sites to be inaccessible. The studies used BOBBY
to check for compliance with the Workforce Investment Act’s (WIA) Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines and Techniques. Rowland and Smith (1999) collected
accessibility data from a random sample of 400 colleges, universities and
online learning institutions and found only 22% of the home pages to be free
from any major (BOBBY “priority 1”) accessibility errors. Results indicate that
these errors are “show stoppers” that would make it impossible for one or more
groups to access the information contained on the page. A follow up study
examined the home pages of the distance education “entry point” and found only
24% accessible (Rowland, 2000). A UK study surveyed higher education lecturers
about their awareness of accessible Web content design, specifically the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) accessibility guidelines (Sams and Yates-Mercer,
2000). Only nine of the seventy-four respondents actually tested their sites
for accessibility and nearly half (47%) did not provide alternative text
descriptions of images -- a very basic accessibility issue. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Schmetzke (2000) examined the home pages of 219
post-secondary distance education institutions and discovered that only 15%
were accessible. When pages linked to the home pages of these institutions were
included, there was a slight improvement; however, Schmetzke still found only
23% free from major accessibility errors.  A building analogy suggested by
Rowland (2000) seems very appropriate to this situation. Imagine if you need to
meet someone in a large office building.  The building has many floors and many
units per floor, with departments nested within units. How easy would it be to
get to a specific person you needed to meet if three out of every four doors in
the building are locked to you? It is unknown how similar corporate training
sites are in this regard, but these results highlights a potential problem
regarding accessibility of online training for employees with disabilities.  </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>There are some promising signs on the online E-learning
accessibility front as well. Microsoft has begun offering courseware designed
to be accessible to visually impaired students (Kiser, 2001). In January 2000 a
courseware vendor, Mindleaders, began collaborating with the Texas Commission
for the Blind working to make its Web-based training user-friendly for those
with visual impairments. Since this agreement they have produced text only
versions of more than 500 of their courses. The courses also allow the use of
command keys to navigate, search the glossary, and answer questions among other
features (Mindleaders, 2000).</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc152574898">Conclusions</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Effective HR management can give a company a competitive
advantage by helping make the best use of employees’ skills. The integrated
solutions offered by E-HR have the potential to reduce data entry, minimize
errors, and cut down the time required to maintain the overall HR
infrastructure (McCausland, 2001). Applications such as job postings, employee
benefit information, and online training and registration are “value added”
offerings for employees as well. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A vast number of HR transactions currently occur online,
and according to all reports this number will continue to increase. A report by
the AberdeenGroup Inc., a Boston-based IT consulting firm, suggests that HR
transactions are just the beginning. Uses of the Internet for business will not
be limited to HR purposes. Applications will likely be available to assist the
employee to perform almost everything job related: HR processes, procurement,
travel arrangements, expense filing, and provision of information and content
directly related to job duties (Roberts, 2001). Indeed the findings of a recent
e-Track survey performed by Towers Perrin (2001) of executives from a cross
section of 248 larger companies support this conclusion.  They found that 54%
used the Web as a vehicle for employees to perform HR transactions (while 38%
more planned to), while fully 64% currently used the Web to streamline
operational processes (again, an additional 28% more planned to), and 81% used
it for internal communication and information sharing with employees (16% more
were planning to). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Given that so many human resource functions and much of
the employment process increasingly are being delivered by Web-based
approaches, knowledge of how to access and navigate the Internet is absolutely
imperative for all job seekers and incumbents.  It is vital to gain an
understanding of the accessibility of E-HR in order to be prepared to cope with
a Web-based revolution in the workplace, as the Web will become central to the
essential functions of many jobs in the near future.  The need to gain and keep
current the skills to use information technology (IT) is equally important to
people with disabilities.   IT can offer people with disabilities a window on
the world and access to jobs that previously have not been available to them. 
However, the inaccessibility of most Web sites, as well as the lack of adequate
preparation offered to many youth and older individuals with disabilities to
deal with this medium, may only serve to widen the already-existing disparity
in employment opportunities for people with disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Americans with Disabilities Act, and its predecessor,
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, were passed in an attempt to address workplace
and cultural inequities for people with disabilities.  The implementation of
the employment provisions of disability civil rights legislation falls largely
in the realm of human resource (HR) professionals.  HR professionals are often
the architects of workplace policies and practices governing the employment
process.  Also, HR professionals, working with supervisors, often play a
critical role in responding to requests for workplace accommodations for
employees with disabilities.  HR professionals can create a more disability
friendly environment in their employment settings by putting in place policies
and procedures which minimize, if not eliminate, needless discrimination
against applicants and employees with disabilities.  </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>These disability nondiscrimination polices and practices
must be applied to employment process functions on the Internet, such as those
illustrated in this review of the literature on information technology
applications to the human resource process.  Few human resource professionals
or their employers fully realize the potential discriminatory impact of these
E-HR applications, or are equipped to proactively eliminate this needless
barrier to the workplace and the employment process.  Significant education is
needed to raise awareness of these issues, with employers, human resource
professionals, and the information technology professionals that are the
architects of these Internet employment process functions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Compared to their non-disabled peers, people with
disabilities are less likely to have computer skills and less likely to use
computers or the Internet, despite the advantages those technologies provide.  
Education and training via the Internet and distance learning programs offer
easier access to skill development for people with disabilities, but only if
they have the basic skills to use computer equipment. They need to know about
vocational options and labor market demands. They need to be motivated, in part
by the availability of jobs, to take part in educational efforts, and finally
they need to have the access to computers. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Therefore, education about use of information technology
becomes even more imperative for people with disabilities. Yet currently,
people with disabilities in education and training programs have lower
participation rates as a consequence of attitudinal barriers and accessibility
problems.  People with disabilities must have an equal opportunity to acquire
the skills that are in high demand both for emerging new technical jobs, and to
access jobs among non-technical industries. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Educational institutions can assist by identifying and
documenting any unique needs of students with disabilities in accessing IT
technology in the educational setting. They can also identify and implement
strategies to meet these needs for successful full participation in this
learning process.  Governmental bodies can assist by stimulating partnerships
(training, internships, mentoring) between educational institutions and private
sector employers to fund the kind of education needed to appropriately equip
young people with disabilities in the IT labor force.  Current technology
training initiatives under President Bush’s New Freedom Initiative, as well as
the proposed Disability and Business Technical Assistance Center (DBTAC)
initiative are significant steps forward in this process.</p>
