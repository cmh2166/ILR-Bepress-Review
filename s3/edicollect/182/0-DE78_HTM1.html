<h2>About the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Disability Demographics and Statistics</h2> 
<p> 
The Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Disability Demographics and Statistics (StatsRRTC) bridges the divide between the sources of disability data and the users of disability statistics. We conduct research exploring the reliability of existing data sources and collection methods, and study the potential to improve current and future data collection efforts.  
</p> 
<p>
The StatsRRTC is an interdisciplinary effort of three organizations at Cornell University: the Employment and Disability Institute, the Department of Policy Analysis and Management, and the Institute for Policy Research in Washington, DC. In addition, expertise is drawn from the following collaborating institutions: American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), Center for an Accessible Society, InfoUse, Institute for Matching Person and Technology, Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., and The Urban Institute.

The Annual Disability Status Reports: Introduction
</h2>
<p>
The Annual Disability Status Reports provide policy makers, disability advocates, reporters, and the public with a summary of the most recent demographic and economic statistics on the working-age (ages 21-64) population with disabilities. They contain information on the population size, prevalence, employment, earnings, poverty, household income, home ownership, and activity limitations of working-age people with disabilities, as well as the composition of this population by age, race, gender, and educational attainment. Comparisons are made to working-age people without disabilities, across types of disabilities, and to the previous year. Additional statistics by state are available at www.DisabilityStatistics.org.
</p>
<p>
The Status Reports look at the working-age population (21-64) because the employment gap between people with and without disabilities is a major focus of government programming and advocacy efforts.  Furthermore, employment is a key factor in the social integration and economic self-sufficiency of working-age people with disabilities.  Future Status Reports will address the school- and retirement-age populations and eventually expand to education and health-related issues.
</p>
<p>The estimates in the 2004 Status Reports are based on American Community Survey (ACS) data-a survey of the U.S. Census Bureau designed to replace the decennial census long form. In future years, we hope to add information derived from other data sources, such as the Current Population Survey (CPS) and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). See ACS User Guide on our web site, www.DisabilityStatistics.org for additional disability-related information in the ACS. A Census Bureau report, www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p60-226.pdf, provides a broader discussion of the ACS.</p>
<p>
The estimates in these reports are based on responses from a sample of the population and may differ from actual values because of sampling variability or other factors. As a result, apparent differences between the estimates for two or more groups may not be statistically significant. Asterisks (*) indicate whether increases and decreases are statistically significant at the 90-percent confidence level.
