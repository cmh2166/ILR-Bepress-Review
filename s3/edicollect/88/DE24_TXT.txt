Cornell University is currently funded by the U.S. Department of Education National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research for a four-year Research and Demonstration entitled Improving Employment Practices Covered by Title I of the ADA (Grant # H133A70005).  As a part of these efforts, we have done an extensive literature review on topics related to employer practices and the employment provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  This bibliography is the result of these eighteen months of efforts.  This publication is available as a print product, and is accessible online at http://www.ilr.cornell.edu.  We hope that these resources will be of assistance in helping human resource professionals, employers, providers of vocational rehabilitation services, advocacy organizations, and persons with disabilities and their family members to better employ the ADA in effectively implementing the accommodation process.
