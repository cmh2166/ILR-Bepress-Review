<p align="center"><strong><big><big><big>New York Implements Medicaid Buy-In Program<br>
</big></big></big>Program Allows Individuals With Disabilities to Work and Keep Medicaid</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many persons with significant disabilities
are unable to obtain employer-funded private health insurance that provides coverage
comparable to Medicaid. The fear of losing Medicaid is one of the greatest barriers
keeping individuals with disabilities from maximizing their employment, earnings
potential, and independence. For many Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries, the risk of losing Medicaid through work
activity is an equal or greater work disincentive than the risk of losing cash benefits
through work activity. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we explain below, since 1987 when the
section 1619(b) Medicaid provisions became permanent, SSI beneficiaries have been able to
keep Medicaid when they lose cash benefits due to wages. No parallel provisions have
existed for persons who do not receive SSI, including individuals who receive SSDI without
an SSI supplement. Although SSDI beneficiaries who work are eligible for extended Medicare
coverage for eight years or more following a nine-month trial work period, Medicare
typically does not provide the scope of coverage available through Medicaid. Medicare, for
example, does not pay for prescription drugs and has very restrictive and limited coverage
for home health care benefits, two services covered by Medicaid. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Congress created the Medicaid Buy-In option
in section 4733 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and enhanced this option through the
Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. By authorizing states to offer
Buy-In programs, these landmark pieces of legislation created an opportunity for states to
develop comprehensive work incentives that encourage people with disabilities to work or
increase their levels of work, thereby reducing or eliminating their dependency on cash
benefits. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New York is now implementing the Medicaid
Buy-In program adopted by our state legislature and signed by Governor Pataki on January
16, 2002. The legislation, sections 62-69 of Part A of Chapter 1 of the State Health
Workforce Recruitment and Retention Act of 2002, extends Medicaid coverage to working
individuals with disabilities who have net incomes at or below 250 percent of the federal
poverty level and non-exempt resources at or below $10,000. Because SSI-related earned
income exclusions are used to determine net income in the Buy-In program, this means that
an individual could be eligible for the program with annual income as high as $46,170.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, the legislation was to be
implemented by April 1, 2003, but implementation was delayed. Fortunately, as the April
2003 date approached and the community of working individuals with disabilities pressured
the state to make implementation a priority, the Governor announced that the legislation
would become effective on July 1, 2003, even if no regulations had been published. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 9, 2003, the Department of Health
issued Administrative Directive (ADM) 03-04, providing local Departments of Social
Services interim implementation instructions for the Buy-In program. Although regulations
had still not been published as of late June 2003, the state had geared up to begin
accepting applications for the program on July 1st.<br>
To provide readers a comprehensive view of where the Buy-In fits in, this article will:
explain what Medicaid is and what it covers; provide an explanation of the 1619(b) program
for former SSI beneficiaries who can keep Medicaid while working; and explain the spend
down program for individuals with income that is higher than Medicaid&#146;s eligibility
threshold. Finally, this article will discuss the requirements of the Medicaid Buy-In,
including who is covered, how one applies, and who makes the eligibility decisions. </p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>WHAT IS MEDICAID? </strong></big></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medicaid, also known as Medical Assistance,
is a publicly funded health insurance program. The federal, state and local governments
share Medicaid costs. It is administered at the state level by the State Department of
Health. At the local level, the county Departments of Social Services (DSS) administer
Medicaid, except in New York City where it is run by the Human Resources Administration
(HRA). </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medicaid should be distinguished from
Medicare, a federal insurance program most frequently associated with receipt of Social
Security benefits. An SSDI beneficiary qualifies for Medicare after 24 months of
eligibility. Medicare Part A, hospital insurance, is automatic and cost free. Part B is
optional and subject to a monthly premium (i.e., $58.70 in 2003). Medicaid can pay the
Part B premiums for many individuals who receive both Medicaid and Medicare. Since
Medicare has very limited coverage of community-based care, it is not as important as
Medicaid to persons with disabilities. </p>

<p>Services Covered By Medicaid </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New York&#146;s Medicaid program covers more than 40 categories of
services. The more important Medicaid services, for persons with disabilities, tend to be
those that are most expensive and often not covered by employer-funded insurance plans.
These include:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#149; Inpatient and outpatient hospital care<br>
  &#149; Physician&#146;s services<br>
  &#149; Mental health counseling<br>
  &#149; Home health care, including personal care services and private duty nursing<br>
  &#149; Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy<br>
  &#149; Prescription drugs<br>
  &#149; Durable medical equipment </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the services available to all
Medicaid beneficiaries in the state, New York provides additional services to special
populations under Medicaid Waiver programs. For example, one waiver program for persons
with developmental disabilities will fund certain vocational services, including job
coaching. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>BASIC MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY CONCEPTS </big></strong></p>

<p align="center"><em><big><strong>SSI and Welfare Recipients Qualify for Medicaid
Automatically</strong></big></em></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In New York, recipients of SSI and welfare
benefits, including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and Safety Net benefits
qualify for Medicaid automatically.</p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>Some Former SSI Recipients Continue to Qualify for
Automatic Medicaid</strong></big></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Fall 2001 issue of the Benefits Planner
described the conditions under which four separate classes of former SSI recipients can
retain automatic Medicaid. This includes individuals eligible under the 1619(b)
provisions, discussed below, and three other categories of recipients: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#149; Individuals who lose SSI when they become eligible for Social Security
  widows/widowers benefits retain Medicaid during the 24-month waiting period for Medicare.</p>
  <p>&#149; Under the Pickle Amendment, individuals become eligible for Medicaid at the
  future date when they would once again become eligible for SSI if cost-of-living increases
  in Social Security benefits, since the last month they received SSI and Social Security,
  are ignored.</p>
  <p>&#149; Individuals who lose SSI when they become eligible for Social Security Disabled
  Adult (DAC) Child&#146;s benefits or an increase in those benefits retain automatic
  Medicaid if they would be eligible for SSI by ignoring the DAC benefits or most recent DAC
  increase. </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><strong>All Others Must Submit an Application</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Persons who do not receive SSI or welfare
benefits, including SSDI beneficiaries, must apply for Medicaid through the local DSS or
HRA. Persons with disabilities must satisfy both the categorical (i.e., disability) and
financial eligibility requirements. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>SECTION 1619(b) &#150; CONTINUED MEDICAID FOLLOWING A LOSS OF
SSI DUE TO WAGES </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The section 1619(b) program is a powerful
work incentive. A permanent part of the SSI program since 1987, this provision allows
individuals, in most cases, to retain Medicaid when they lose SSI due to increased wages. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If an SSI beneficiary works, the first $65
of wages each month is not counted (or $85 if there is no unearned income). The SSI check
is then reduced by $1 for every additional $2 of gross monthly wages. For a person who
lives alone, SSI eligibility will cease if they earn $1,363 or more per month in 2003.
This is because countable income, at this rate of pay, would be equal to the SSI living
alone rate of $639 per month. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1619(b) allows automatic Medicaid to
continue if a person loses SSI due to wages. If the person is still disabled and would be
eligible for SSI if the wages were not counted, Medicaid should continue. In New York, the
2003 income limit is $34,136 in wages per year. The income limit can be higher if medical
expenses are high enough. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two examples show how section 1619(b) could
work. Cynthia suffered a back injury on the job. She resides with her two young children
and receives $520 in SSDI benefits and $75 in SSI benefits. What if she goes to work part
time and earns $365 per month in gross wages? She will lose SSI benefits. This is because
$500 of her SSDI and $150 of her wages will be counted against the living with others SSI
rate of $575. Under these facts, Cynthia should be able to continue Medicaid through
1619(b). This is because she lost her SSI due to wages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What if Cynthia&#146;s earnings increase to
$885 per month? She would probably lose her SSDI if she has already exhausted her trial
work period (see the Summer 2001 issue of the Benefits Planner). If she loses her SSDI,
the 1619(b) rules will allow her to once again qualify for SSI benefits of $175 per month,
based on SSI&#146;s formula for counting earned income ($885 - 20 - 65 = 800 ÷ 2 = $400;
$575 - 400 = $175 SSI payment). Until she loses her SSDI benefits, she will continue to be
ineligible for SSI, but will be eligible for 1619(b) Medicaid. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William, an SSI beneficiary who is spinal
cord injured, goes to work and earns $36,000 per year. He loses SSI benefits and his
annual wages are more than the 1619(b) income threshold of $34,136. He can keep Medicaid
under 1619(b) if his Medicaid costs are high enough. If we assume Medicaid would pay
$25,000 per year for medical expenses (most of this would be for home health care), that
amount would be added to a &#147;base amount&#148; of $16,356 and William&#146;s
&#147;individualized&#148; 1619(b) threshold for 2003 would be $41,356. Since his $36,000
salary is below that figure, William remains eligible for Medicaid. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To remain 1619(b) eligible, the
individual&#146;s resources must stay within SSI limits. This means an individual&#146;s
non-exempt assets cannot exceed $2,000. This would limit the person&#146;s ability to save
for a house, for a car, for a child&#146;s education, or for retirement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unearned income must also be within SSI
limits to retain 1619(b) eligibility. If either Cheryl or William, in the examples above,
were to get married, they could cease to be eligible for 1619(b) Medicaid if the
spouse&#146;s income is high enough. This is because the income of a spouse, which is
deemed available to the other spouse, is considered the unearned income of that other
spouse. For example, based on 2003 SSI rates, Cheryl or William would cease to be eligible
for 1619(b) Medicaid if the spouse&#146;s gross earned income is $1,835 per month or
higher.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1619(b) has a major limitation
&#150; it is only available to individuals who have received an SSI check in the past! The
makes the Medicaid Buy-In an important, additional work incentive. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>THE MEDICALLY NEEDY OR SPEND DOWN PROGRAM</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a person is not eligible for SSI or
welfare benefits (or eligible for continued Medicaid as a former SSI recipient under one
of the special rules discussed above), he or she must apply separately for Medicaid. A
single individual with a disability will be eligible, under 2003 rules, if countable
income is no more than $642 per month and resources no more than $3,850. If income is more
than $642 the individual will qualify only with a spend down. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>Income Disregards for Persons Who are Working</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medicaid&#146;s rules for disregarding
income are nearly identical to SSI&#146;s rules. The first $20 of unearned income is
disregarded. The following amounts are disregarded from earned income: the first $65 (or
$85 if there is no unearned income); impairment related work expenses; one half of
remaining earned income; blind work expenses, for persons who are legally blind; up to
$1,340 per calendar month, but not more than $5,410 per year for a full-time student under
age 22; and any income set aside in a Plan for Achieving Self Support (PASS). [For a
listing of all income disregards, see 18 N.Y.C.R.R. § 360-4.6(a).] </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider June, who is deaf and receives $712
in SSDI benefits. She earns too much to qualify for SSI. After a $20 deduction, it is also
$50 more than the $642 income limit for Medicaid, meaning June will have a $50 per month
Medicaid spend down. June goes to work and earns $465 gross per month. The Medicaid
program will disregard the first $65 which June earns and disregard an additional 50
percent, leaving her with $200 in countable wages ($465 - 65 = 400 ÷ 2 = $200). Her
countable income is now $875 per month ($692 unearned + $200 earned), making her spend
down $250 per month. Thus, as her income went up by $465, her spend down increased by
$200. June&#146;s countable income could be reduced further if she were to put all or part
of this $250 into an approved PASS (see immediately below). </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>Medicaid&#146;s Plan for Achieving Self Support </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PASS is best known as an SSI work
incentive. It allows a person to take income or resources that would be counted by SSI and
exclude the money by using it to help the person achieve a vocational goal. SSI&#146;s
PASS has, for example, been used to take SSDI benefits or wages and use the money for
items like tuition, computer equipment, or a vehicle. When the PASS is approved, the
person qualifies for SSI without counting the excluded income. [See the Summer 2002 issue
of the Benefits Planner.]</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A PASS can also be used to exclude income or
resources that would be counted by Medicaid. 18 N.Y.C.R.R. § 360-4.6 (a) (2) (xxiii). For
example, consider Mary who is spinal cord injured. She receives $1012 in SSDI benefits
each month. After the first $20 of her SSDI is excluded, Mary&#146;s monthly income is
$350 above the one-person Medicaid limit of $642. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary proposes to set aside $250 per month
($3,000 per year) in a PASS to save toward the purchase of a modified van and a laptop
computer to pursue a career in accounting. If approved by Medicaid, Mary&#146;s countable
income is reduced from $992 to $742 and her spend down is reduced from $350 to $100 per
month. If Mary sets aside $350 in an approved PASS her spend down will be eliminated. Mary
can also reduce her countable resources below the $3,850 limit by designating part of her
savings toward PASS expenses. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A PASS can fund a wide range of items,
including child care, equipment or supplies to start a business (including a business
operated from the home), and modifications to vehicles or buildings to allow use by a the
person with a disability. So long as the cost is connected to the long-term vocational
goal, it should be allowed under Medicaid&#146;s PASS. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>THE NEED FOR A MEDICAID BUY-IN PROGRAM </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As already noted, the section 1619(b)
program is only available to persons who have received SSI in the past. For persons with
disabilities eligible for Medicaid only through the medically needy program, as their
wages increase their spend down obligation may increase to a level that makes continued
work unrealistic. In fact, if wages remain above the substantial gainful activity level
($800 in 2003), Medicaid will no longer be available with a spend down because the
individual would not meet the SSI definition of disability. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>NEW YORK&#146;S MEDICAID BUY-IN PROGRAM</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New York just became the 27th state to
implement a Buy-In program. New York&#146;s program is quite unique as it will establish
two eligibility groups: the Basic Coverage Group and the Medical Improvement Group. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>The Basic Coverage Group</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be eligible for the Basic Coverage Group,
an individual must have a disability that meets the medical criteria established for the
SSI program, but have too much income to qualify for SSI. In addition to the usual
Medicaid rules, the specific requirements are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#149; Disability - Certified disabled under SSI criteria<br>
  &#149; No SGA test - In determining disability, there is no &#147;substantial gainful
  activity&#148; (SGA) test (i.e., earnings over $800 per month in 2003 are irrelevant)<br>
  &#149; Age - Be at least 16 but not yet 65 years old<br>
  &#149; Work - Be engaged in paid work (includes part-time and full-time work)<br>
  &#149; Income - Have a gross income that may be as high as $46,170 for an individual and
  $61,870 for a couple (as of January 1, 2003)<br>
  &#149; Resources - Have non-exempt resources that do not exceed $10,000 </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><strong><big>The Medical Improvement Group </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be eligible for the Medical Improvement
Group, an individual must meet all the criteria met by individuals in the Basic Coverage
Group. Additionally, the individual must be in receipt of coverage through the basic
group, no longer disabled under the SSI criteria but continuing to have a severe medically
determined impairment. Keep in mind that loss of eligibility under the Basic Coverage
Group must be the direct and specific result of loss of disability status because of
medical improvement. Finally, an individual in the Medical Improvement Group must be
employed at least 40 hours per month and earn at least the federally required minimum
wage.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not expect to see many participants in
the Medical Improvement Group due to the requirement that a recipient be a participant in
the Basic Coverage Group prior to being eligible for the Medical Improvement Group. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>How the Premium Works </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For both groups, individuals with net income
below 150 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) will not need to pay a premium.
Individuals with a net income above 150 percent of the FPL but below 250 percent of the
FPL will have a premium calculated as follows: 3 percent of net earned income plus 7.5
percent of net unearned income. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luckily, for an individual who qualifies for
the Medicaid Buy-In program now, a moratorium on premium payments has been instituted
until such time as systems support for automated premium collection and tracking is
available. The Department of Health estimates that the implementation date for collection
of premiums will be in the Spring 2004. Individuals who are then found eligible for the
program but with a premium will be assessed a premium prospectively. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>The Application Process</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Individuals must apply for the Medicaid
Buy-In program at their local Department of Social Services (DSS) by completing the form
all applicants for public assistance complete, Form 2921, &#147;Application for Public
Assistance/Medical Assistance/Food Stamps/Services.&#148; In addition, the local DSS must
conduct a face-to-face interview to ensure that the applicant meets the basic program
requirements. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those cases in which the individual has
not been previously certified disabled, the local DSS must assist the applicant in
establishing proof of disability by having the individual sign the appropriate consent
forms for release of medical information and by sending requests for medical information
to all relevant medical providers. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all cases, the local DSS must provide
information to the applicant about the Plan for Achieving Self Support (PASS) and
Impairment Related Work Expenses (IRWE). The authors are hopeful that the Department of
Health will train local Medicaid caseworkers concerning the PASS, IRWEs, and other
SSI-related work incentive provisions, as these special rules have long been overlooked in
the Medicaid program. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applicants with an income that is below 150
percent of the federal poverty level are eligible to participate in a managed care plan
through the Medicaid Buy-In program. All other applicants are excluded from the managed
care option. Individuals cannot be required to enroll in managed care even in counties
with mandatory participation in managed care. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Local DSS agencies must send application
packages - consisting of copies of the application, all required documentation for
eligibility and consent for release of medical information forms and requests for medical
records &#150; to the Medicaid Buy-In Coordinator at the Department of Health&#146;s
Albany Central Office for processing. According to the ADM, local DSS agencies must
forward application packages to the Albany Central Office for processing, within 10 days
of the application, even if it does not contain all the required documentation. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the application for the Buy-In program is
granted, the recipient will be entitled to up to three months of retroactive eligibility.
Recipients found eligible prior to October 1, 2003 will be eligible for retroactive
eligibility to July 1, 2003 only. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>Grace Periods </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A major question asked by individuals
awaiting news implementing the Medicaid Buy-In program is what happens to a participant if
he or she stops working while participating in the program. According to the ADM,
recipients may be granted a grace period if the individual is not working but remains
eligible for the program. A grace period can be for up to six months in a 12-month period.
Multiple grace periods may be granted as long as the sum of the grace periods does not
exceed six months in a 12-month period. Two types of grace periods may be granted.</p>

<p><strong>Change in Medical Condition</strong>. A grace period of up to six months will
be allowed if, for medical reasons, the recipient is unable to continue working. Medical
verification will be required.</p>

<p><strong>Job Loss (through no fault of participant)</strong>. A grace period of up to
six months will be allowed if, through no fault of the recipient, job loss occurs (layoff,
etc.). The local DSS must verify that the recipient is reasonably expected to return to
work as it is a temporary layoff, or that the recipient is actively seeking new
employment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The local DSS will be responsible for grace
period determinations. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>Miscellaneous Details, Next Steps </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For mixed households, only the applicant for
the Buy-In program will be eligible for participation in the program. For mixed
households, only the application of the individual, seeking assistance from the program,
will be processed by the Albany Central Office. Normal Medicaid eligibility for the rest
of the household will be determined by the local DSS. For an existing mixed household, the
local DSS will coordinate with the Albany Central Office to set up a separate case. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the ADM, an additional
administrative directive will be issued at a later date to explain the automated premium
payment system as well as the transition of the Medicaid Buy-In program to the local DSS
agencies from the Albany Central Office. In addition, New York City, and its Human
Resources Agency, will have its own case processing instructions for the Buy-In program.

<p align="center"><big><strong>Conclusion</strong></big></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Medicaid Buy-In program promises to
address the health care needs of many New Yorkers who want to work despite severe
disabilities. Combined with the continued availability of section 1619(b) Medicaid, there
should now be a means for ensuring continued Medicaid eligibility for nearly all
individuals with disabilities who hope to work for significant wages. Readers of this
newsletter can play a major role in helping to get out the word about this new work
incentive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question: I am single, 53 years old, have a
mental illness, and receive $762 in Social Security Disability Insurance benefits (my only
source of income). Medicaid pays for my psychiatrist, mental health counselor, and two
different medications. If I had to pay out-of-pocket for these services, they would cost
me $1,200 to $1,300 per month. Currently, I pay a $100 per month spend down to keep
Medicaid. If I took a job paying $765 gross per month, what would happen to my spend down?
Might I be eligible for the Medicaid Buy-In? Would the Buy-In still cover me if my wages
increased to $1,500 per month? </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer: Based on these facts,
Medicaid&#146;s spend down program would disregard the first $65 and half your remaining
wages, leaving you with $350 of additional countable income per month ($765 - 65 = 700 ÷
2 = 350). This means your spend down would increase by $350 per month. After payroll
taxes, transportation costs, and other work-related expenses, this might not leave you
much gain from your work efforts. Also, if your wages do go above $800 per month in 2003,
you stand to lose your right to a spend down because you would not be considered disabled.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that you would be eligible for
the Medicaid Buy-In, as you meet the tests for disability, age, work, and income. Your
countable, or non-exempt resources would have to be under $10,000, considerably more than
the $3,850 allowed by the spend down program. As a single individual, you would be
eligible for the Buy-In with a premium at income levels up to $46,170 per year (i.e., 250
percent of the federal poverty level after SSI-related exclusions), based on information
provided by the State Department of Health. At annual earned income levels up to about
$28,000 (i.e., 150 percent of the federal poverty level), you would pay no premiums. So,
even based on the higher, $1,500 per month in wages, you would not have to pay a premium,
if that were your only source of income. If you also retained the $762 in SSDI, you would
probably face a monthly premium when the program starts collecting premium payments in
early 2004.<br>
If you plan to go to work and consider using the Buy-In, it would be in your best interest
to consult the Benefits Planning, Assistance and Outreach (BPA&amp;O) program for your
part of the state. A benefits specialist from the BPA&amp;O can analyze all the
eligibility criteria for the Medicaid Buy-In, as well as how work would affect your other
benefits and any other work incentives that might be available. Call our toll-free
technical assistance line at 1-888-224-3272 for the number of the BPA&amp;O program
nearest to you. </p>
