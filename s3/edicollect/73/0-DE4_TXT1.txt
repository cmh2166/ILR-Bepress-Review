ABSTRACT

This report uses data from the March Current Population Survey to estimate the 
prevalence of disability among the non-institutionalized working-age (aged 25 
through 61) civilian population in the United States, and for each state and the 
District of Columbia for the years 1981 through 1999.  Two definitions of 
disability that are commonly used in the literature-work limitation and work 
disability-are utilized.  The prevalence of work limitation and work disability 
varies greatly across states and over time.  However, rankings by state and 
variation in prevalence over time are not dramatically affected by choice of 
definition.

INTRODUCTION

Working-age people (aged 25 through 61) are a heterogeneous group.  State 
governments are able to track those people with disabilities who participate in 
categorical programs for those with disabilities, e.g., Supplemental Security 
Income, Social Security Disability Insurance, state vocational rehabilitation 
services.  But states are much less able to track their populations with 
disabilities who are not currently receiving state services.  Yet it is 
important that states be able to identify both groups to determine the 
population that might be categorically eligible for state and federal 
initiatives targeted on the working-age population with disabilities.  Hence it 
is valuable to know the prevalence of disability among working-age people in a 
state in a given year.  Furthermore, it is useful to track this population over 
time to allow state governments to better understand the changing population 
they serve and, if necessary, to reallocate their resources accordingly.  By 
making such information available for all states, individual state governments 
can then compare their population with disabilities to those of other states.  
More importantly, they can better compare the size and scope of their programs 
targeted on those with disabilities to those of other states.  For instance, 
with such information state vocational rehabilitation agencies could compare the 
number of people they serve to the estimated number of working-age persons with 
disabilities in their state.  Using this number, they could then compare their 
service delivery rate to that of other states. 

In a similar manner, advocates for persons with disabilities will find such data 
useful in making comparisons over time and across states in their effort to 
change not only government policy but also the practices of private business.  
For example, in an effort to persuade businesses to increase access and/or 
marketing toward persons with disabilities, advocates can show both state 
government and private businesses the size of the population with disabilities 
within their states and how it is changing over time.

The purpose of this report is to provide estimates of the percentage of the non-
institutionalized working-age (aged 25 through 61) civilian population with 
disabilities for the United States, and for each state and the District of 
Columbia, from 1981 through 1999 using the March Supplement of the Current 
Population Survey (CPS).  Brief summaries of state rankings and changes over 
time are provided.  The appendix provides instructions on how to calculate the 
number of non-institutionalized working-age civilians with disabilities.  
Estimated coefficients of variation (relative standard errors) and sample sizes 
are discussed.  These estimated coefficients of variation are used to judge the 
accuracy of the estimated percentage of the non-institutionalized working-age 
civilian population with disabilities.  The appendix also provides information 
for those wishing to average or compare these estimates for consecutive years.

DATA SOURCE

The CPS is a monthly survey of the non-institutionalized population of the 
United States, conducted by the Bureau of the Census on behalf of the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics.  Information is collected from approximately 50,000 households 
(about 150,000 individuals) on labor force characteristics (e.g., employment, 
earnings, hours of work).  One person in the household answers questions for all 
household members.

In March of each year, the CPS basic monthly survey is supplemented with the 
Annual Demographic Survey, also known as the March Supplement or the March 
Income Supplement.  This supplement focuses on sources of income, government 
program participation, previous employment, insurance, and a variety of 
demographic characteristics.  In 1981, the March Supplement was expanded to 
include several questions about disability and income derived from disability 
programs and insurance.  The CPS and the March Supplement are used extensively 
by government agencies, academic researchers, policy makers, journalists, and 
the general public to evaluate government programs, economic well-being and 
behavior of individuals, families and households.*1  

A major advantage of using the CPS to track the population with disabilities is 
its large sample size.  Because the CPS samples approximately 150,000 people, it 
is possible to track this population at both the national and state level.*2  
The March CPS also provides a relatively consistent set of questions on 
disability from year to year.  Since 1981 the March CPS has asked the household 
respondent who, if anyone, has "a health problem or disability which prevents 
them from working or which limits the kind or amount of work they can do."  
However, other aspects of the survey have changed.  In 1994 the CPS moved to 
fully computer-assisted survey interviews, and sample weights based on the 1980 
Census were replaced with sample weights based on the 1990 Census.*3  The 
Monthly Basic Survey was also revised and three new disability questions were 
added.  It is possible that these changes affected the relative measurement of 
the population with disabilities over time.

RESULTS

Unlike most other demographic characteristics, there is no universally accepted 
definition of disability.  Nagi (1991) distinguishes three components of 
disability.  The first component is the presence of a pathology-a physical or 
mental disorders or interruption of a normal process, or both.  This leads to 
the second component, impairment, which Nagi defines as a physiological, 
anatomical, or mental loss or abnormality that limits a person's capacity and 
level of function.  The final component of disability is the inability to 
perform or a limitation in performing socially expected roles and tasks.  Market 
work is a socially expected role.  Hence, those who are unable to perform or are 
limited in their ability to work are considered to have a disability.  While the 
relative importance of environment on a person's ability to perform a socially 
expected task in this definition is controversial, the basic conceptualization 
is a useful one.  

Table 1 provides estimated percentages of non-institutionalized working-age 
civilians with a disability in the United States from 1981 through 1999 using 
two operational definitions of disability that are both consistent with Nagi's 
conceptualization.  Both definitions are based on questions in the CPS.  The 
first row of Table 1 provides estimated percentages of non-institutionalized 
working-age civilians with a work limitation in the United States.  Persons with 
a work limitation are defined as those who report having (or are reported by the 
household's respondent to have) "a health problem or disability which prevents 
them from working or which limits the kind or amount of work they can do."*4  

Clearly, this definition does not completely capture the Nagi conceptualization 
of disability, although it does put disability in the social context of work.  
(It is for this reason that this report focuses on the working-age population, 
aged 25 through 61.)  This simple definition of disability is not directly 
affected by program participation.  This measure of disability is commonly used 
in the economics literature (see Bound and Burkhauser, 1999).  Most recently, 
Burkhauser, Daly and Houtenville (2000) use this definition to estimate the 
employment and economic well-being of the non-institutionalized working-age 
civilian population with a disability.  The work limitation concept of 
disability can also be found in many national surveys (e.g., National Health 
Interview Survey, Survey of Income and Program Participation, Panel Study of 
Income Dynamics) that have been used to measure the working-age population with 
disabilities.  Using this definition, the percentage of non-institutionalized 
working-age civilians with a disability in the United States between 1981 and 
1999 ranged from a low of 7.2 percent in 1988 to a high of 8.4 percent in 1994 
(Table 1, row 1).

The second row of Table 1 provides the estimated percentage of non-
institutionalized working-age civilians with a work disability in the United 
States.  This is a more all encompassing operationalization of the Nagi 
definition.  Persons with a work disability are those who participate in 
disability-related government programs and/or have work restrictions due to 
health or disability.  Specifically, persons with a work disability fall into 
one of the following categories, each of which is related to a question on the 
CPS: (1) they have a work limitation, (2) they did not work in the previous year 
because they were ill or disabled and unable to work, (3) they retired or left a 
job for health reasons, (4) they received veterans' benefits due to a service-
contracted disability in the previous year, (5) they received workers' 
compensation benefits or other benefits in the previous year as a result of job-
related injury or illness, (6) they received Supplemental Security Income 
benefits and were less than 65 years old in the previous year, and/or (7) they 
received Medicare and were less than 65 years in the previous year.*5  By 
definition the prevalence of work disability will always be as high or higher 
than the prevalence of work limitation since having a work limitation is just 
one of several possible reasons for having a work disability.  

Using work disability to operationalize the Nagi conceptualization captures a 
broader population with disabilities in the CPS data.   Bennefield and McNeil 
(1989) and Burkhauser, Haveman and Wolfe (1993) use a definition similar to work 
disability to look at the economic well-being of people with a disability.  A 
shortcoming of using work disability to define disability is that changes in 
public policy that increase or decrease program participation will change the 
number of persons with a work disability.  Using this definition, the percentage 
of non-institutionalized working-age civilians with a disability in the United 
States between 1981 and 1999 ranged from a low of 10.1 percent in 1988 and 1989 
to a high of 11.5 percent in 1994 (Table 1, row 2).

It is important to note that respondents' self-perception of disability as 
captured by either of these two measures can be influenced by social context 
(accommodations and restrictions).  For instance, self-reports of work 
limitation may change over time, even holding the underlying health conditions 
constant, because access to accommodation may change over time and change one's 
self-perception of work limitation.  See Kirchner (1996) for a fuller discussion 
of this issue and the uses of the CPS to analyze "access-oriented" policies.

While by definition the prevalence of disability captured in Table 1 using the 
work disability measure of disability is higher than when using the work 
limitation definition, the trends in both measures are similar.  To illustrate, 
row three of Table 1 shows the percentage point difference in the prevalence 
using the two measures, and row four shows the percentage change between work 
limitations and work disabilities.*6  

Table 2 provides the estimated percentage of non-institutionalized working-age 
civilians with a work limitation for each state and the District of Columbia 
from 1981 through 1999.  The prevalence of work limitation varies greatly across 
states and over time, from a low of 3.5 percent in Connecticut in 1990 to a high 
of 17.0 percent in West Virginia in 1997.  The range is larger across states 
than it is over time.  

Table 3 facilitates comparisons across states by showing the percentage of those 
with a work limitations averaged over all years, 1981 through 1999.  The states 
are ranked and listed in descending order.  The average annual estimated 
percentage of those with a work limitation ranges from 12.2 percent for West 
Virginia to 5.7 percent for New Jersey.  The highest five states are West 
Virginia, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi, while the lowest five 
states are Hawaii, Utah, Nebraska, Connecticut, and New Jersey.  These findings 
are consistent with those of McCoy and Weems (1989) who found the highest rates 
of Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance receipt 
occurred in the "disability belt" of Appalachia and the lower Mississippi 
Valley.  LaPlante (1993) reports a similar finding using the 1980 and 1990 
Census.

Table 3 also illustrates changes in the prevalence of work limitations over 
time.  It shows the percentage of the working-age civilian population with a 
work limitation averaged over the first five years of available data, 1981 
through 1985, and over the last five years, 1995 through 1999.  Corresponding 
state rankings are provided.  The top five states are remarkably stable: West 
Virginia, Arkansas and Tennessee are among the top five states in both the first 
five-year span and the last five-year span.*7  The District of Columbia and 
Mississippi are ranked in the top five in the first five-year span and are 
replaced by Maine and Kentucky in the last five-year span.

The last two columns of Table 3 contain the percentage change from the first 
five-years to the last five-years and the corresponding state rankings.  
Percentage change expresses the change in prevalence in terms relative to the 
magnitude of prevalence, which allows changes in high prevalence states to be 
compared to changes in low prevalence states.*8  According to these 
calculations, Kentucky has the largest percentage increase-the prevalence of 
work limitation in 1995 through 1999 is 34.4 percent larger than in 1981 through 
1985.  Kansas, Wyoming, Massachusetts, and Maine follow Kentucky.  Hawaii has 
the largest percentage decrease-the prevalence of work limitation in 1995 
through 1999 is 20.6 percent smaller than in 1981 through 1985.  Minnesota, 
Delaware, Mississippi, and Arizona follow Hawaii.  The smallest percentage 
changes are in Florida, Washington, and New Mexico, between 1 and -1 percent.

Tables 4 and 5 repeat the same exercise as Tables 2 and 3 but use the work 
disability definition.  The state ranking and changes in the prevalence of 
disability over time in Tables 4 and 5 are very similar to those in Tables 2 and 
3.*9  The estimated percentages of non-institutionalized working-age civilians 
with a work disability range from a low of 5.8 percent in Connecticut in 1990 to 
a high of 19.5 percent in West Virginia in 1997 (Table 4).  These are the same 
states and years cited as the high and low in Table 2.

Table 5 shows that the average annual estimated percentage of non-
institutionalized working-age civilians with a work disability from 1981 to 1999 
ranges from 15.5 percent for West Virginia to 8.2 percent for Connecticut.  The 
highest five states-West Virginia, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, and 
Mississippi-are the same highest five states with the work limitation 
definition, while the lowest five states are now North Dakota, Utah, Nebraska, 
New Jersey, and Connecticut

Table 5 captures change in the prevalence of work disability over time.  West 
Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Mississippi are among the top five states in 
both the first five-year span and the last five-year span.  Rhode Island, ranked 
in the top five in the first five-year span, is replaced by Kentucky in the last 
five-year span.

The last two columns of Table 5 contain the percentage change from the first-
five years to the last five years and the corresponding state rankings.  Kansas 
has the largest percentage increase-the prevalence of work disability in 1995 
through 1999 is 29.9 percent larger than in 1981 through 1985.  Kentucky, 
Oklahoma, Montana and Maine follow Kansas.  Hawaii has the largest percentage 
decrease-21.6 percent smaller in 1995 through 1999 than in 1981 through 1985.  
Rhode Island, Oregon, Michigan, and Arizona follow Hawaii.  The smallest 
absolute changes are in Georgia, Mississippi, Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey 
who have percentage changes between 1 and -1 percent.

CONCLUSION

The prevalence of disability over the last two decades (1981 through 1999) for 
the United States, and for each state and the District of Columbia has varied 
widely using either a work limitation or a work disability definition of 
disability.  Determining the percentage of the population with disabilities is 
the first step in evaluating the employment and economic well-being of this 
population across states and over time.  

APPENDIX 

The number of non-institutionalized working-age civilians with a work limitation 
or with a work disability can be calculated using Appendix Table 1 and Tables 2 
and 4.  Appendix Table 1 contains the estimated non-institutionalized working-
age civilian population (regardless of disability status) for the United States, 
and for each state and the District of Columbia from 1981 through 1999 (in 
thousands).  These are the denominators of the estimated percentages presented 
in Tables 2 and 4. 

For example, the estimated non-institutionalized working-age civilian population 
with a work limitation for New York 1981 is 530,808 persons.  This number is 
obtained by multiplying the estimated percentage of non-institutionalized 
working-age civilians with a work limitation in New York in 1981 (Table 2) by 
the estimated number of non-institutionalized working-age civilians (in 
thousands) in New York in 1981 (Appendix Table 1) and then multiplying by 10 
(i.e., 6.8 multiplied by 7806 multiplied by 10 equals 530808).

Appendix Tables 2 and 3 contain the estimated coefficients of variation (CV, 
also known as relative standard error) that correspond to the estimated 
percentages in Tables 2 and 4, respectively.  Estimated CVs are used to judge 
the precision of the estimates.  How precisely an estimated value reflects the 
actual value is based on the amount of sampling error and non-sampling error.  
Non-sampling error is due to such things as differences in interpreting survey 
questions, incorrect recording of survey responses, or the design of the survey.  
Sampling error exists because the sample being used to calculate the estimated 
value may not accurately represent the population.  An estimated CV is a measure 
of the amount of sampling error and is calculated by dividing the estimated 
standard error of the estimated percentage by the estimated percentage and 
multiplying by 100 (Hamburg 1985).  

Smaller estimated CVs indicate smaller sampling error and thus more precise 
estimates.  A rule of thumb is that an estimated CV of more than 30 indicates 
low statistical accuracy.  This did not occur in any instance.  The highest 
estimated CV is 22.3 for the estimated percentage of non-institutionalized 
working-age civilians with a work limitation in Connecticut for 1990.

Following the guidelines of the Census Bureau, the estimated standard error of a 
state's estimated percentages, is calculated by taking the square root of the 
following: an adjustment factor that accounts for the non-random nature of the 
CPS sample multiplied by a state specific an adjustment factor that accounts for 
the non-random nature of the state's sample multiplied by the reciprocal of that 
state's estimated population multiplied by that state's percentage multiplied by 
the difference between 100 and that state's percentage.  The estimated 
population of states are available in Appendix Table 1.  Following LaPlante 
(1993), the adjustment factor for estimating employment characteristics is used 
for estimating standard error for the estimated percentage with a disability and 
is equal to 2,485 for the 1990 March CPS.  See U.S. Bureau of the Census (1998) 
for the state-specific adjustment factors and more detail on estimating standard 
errors for statistics from the CPS. 

The accuracy of an estimated value is linked to the number of people used to 
calculate the estimated value.  Appendix Table 4 contains the sample sizes used 
to calculate the estimated percentages in Tables 1, 2, and 4.  Note that the 
estimated percentage with a work limitation and the estimated percentage with a 
work disability for a given location use the same sample size because both are 
based on the same sample.  This is similar to the estimated population in 
Appendix Table 1.  The estimated population is the weighted sample size.  The 
Census Bureau provides weights that allow for population estimates.  A sample 
member's weight is roughly interpreted as the number of persons in the United 
States population that he or she represents.  Summing the sample weights of 
sample members is an estimate of the population.  For example, the estimated 
number of non-institutionalized working-age civilians for Alabama in 1981 
(1,676,000, taken from Appendix Table 1) is the sum of these weights for the 
1,232 non-institutionalized working-age civilians from Alabama in the 1981 March 
CPS.

Averaging estimated percentages over consecutive years and subtracting estimated 
percentage of one year from to the next year are straightforward exercises.  
However, determining the statistical accuracy of the resulting average or 
difference is not straightforward.  The design of the CPS causes a problem.  In 
the March CPS of any given year, approximately half of the households were 
surveyed the prior March, while the remaining households are eligible to be 
surveyed the following March.  See Census Bureau (1998) for more information.  
The estimated standard errors of an average or a difference must be adjusted to 
account for correlation across consecutive years.  For example, an individual's 
responses in March 1998 are correlated with his or her responses in March 1999.  
Roughly speaking, the estimated standard errors are measures of the variation, 
and the correlation across years must be taken into consideration.  

Following Census Bureau guidelines, the formula for the estimated CV for the 
difference in estimated percentages between 1990 and 1989 is the reciprocal of 
the difference the percentages in 1990 and 1989 multiplied by the square root of 
the following:  the standard error of the percentage in 1990 squared plus the 
standard error of the percentage in 1989 minus the following product 2 
multiplied by the correlation coefficient of 1990 and 1989 multiplied by the 
standard error of the percentage in 1990 multiplied by the standard error of the 
percentage in 1989.  Appendix Table 5 contains estimated correlation 
coefficients for the United States, which can be used to approximate estimated 
correlation coefficients for a given state.  The estimated standard errors can 
be obtained by multiplying the estimated coefficient of variation by the 
estimated percentage and then dividing by 100. 

The general formula for averaging over more than consecutive years is the 
reciprocal of the sum of the percentages of each year multiplied by the square 
root of the following: the summation of the squared standard error of the 
percentage of each year plus the summation over all the consecutive year pairs 
of the following product: the correlation coefficient of a pair of consecutive 
multiplied by the standard error of the first year multiplied by the standard 
error of the second year.   The correlation coefficient of a pair of consecutive 
are available in Appendix Table 5.

2. See LaPlante (1993) for a fuller discussion of the statistical accuracy of 
CPS estimates of state populations with disabilities in comparison to estimates 
from the Decennial Census and the National Health Interview Survey.

3. Ryscavage (1995) found that these changes influenced the estimation income 
inequality in the United States.

4. Work limitation is based on the following questions: (62A) Does anyone in 
this household have a health problem or disability which prevents them from 
working or which limits the kind or amount of work they can do?  (62B) If yes to 
62A., who is that? (Anyone else?) These questions are from the 1981 survey.  The 
wording of the question reveals the fact that a single household member answers 
the survey for all household members.  The Census Bureau recodes the survey to 
the individual level, so researchers can generate statistics for individuals.

5. Work disability is based on work limitation and the following questions.  
These questions are taken directly from the 1981 survey.  (32) What was the main 
reason... did not work in 1980 (last year)? Was he...ill or disabled and unable 
to work?  Taking care of home or family?  Going to school?  Could not find work?  
In the Armed Forces?  Retired?  Doing something else?  (63A) Is there anyone in 
this household who ever retired or left a job for health reasons? (63B) Who is 
that? Anyone else?  (60C) What type of Veterans' payments did ... receive?  
Service-contracted disability?  Survivor benefits?  Veterans' pension?  
Educational assistance?  Other Veterans' payments? (52A) During 1980 did ... 
receive any Workers' Compensation payments or other payments as a result of job 
related injury or illness? Exclude sick pay and disability retirement.  (57) 
During 1980 did anyone in this household receive: (57A) Any SSI payments, that 
is, Supplemental Security Income?  (57B) If yes to 57A, who received SSI?  (74) 
There are several government programs which provide medical care or help pay 
medical bills.  During 19XX was anyone in this household covered by: (74A) 
Medicare (for the disabled and elderly)? (74B) If yes to 74A, who was that? 
(Anyone else?) 

6. The percentage point difference in the prevalence of work disability minus 
the prevalence of work limitation.  The percentage change is percentage point 
difference divided by the average of the two prevalences multiplied by 100.  The 
difference between the two measures is in part due to the fact that work 
limitation is reported at the time of the survey while many of the other 
categories of work disability are categories reported for the previous year.  
For example, people may receive workers' compensation in the previous year and 
no longer have a work limitation at the time of the survey.

7. The estimated correlation of the prevalence of work limitation in the first 
five-year span and last five-year span is remarkably high, 0.80.  This suggests 
the state level conditions that are conducive to work limitations are persistent 
over time and/or that geographic mobility among people with a work limitation is 
small.

8. Specifically, the percentage change is calculated by subtracting the 
prevalence in the last five-year span from the first five-year span and then 
dividing that difference by the average of two prevalences, all multiplied by 
100.  

9. The estimated correlation of the prevalence of work limitation averaged over 
1981 through 1999 and the prevalence of work disability averaged over 1981 
through 1999 is 0.985.  This high degree of correlation suggests that there is 
very little difference between the ranking of states using work limitation and 
using work disability.  The estimated correlation between the percentage changes 
presented in Tables 3 and 5 for the prevalence of work limitation and the 
prevalence of work disability is 0.892.  This high correlation suggests very 
little difference between the changes in the populations with a work limitation 
and with a work disability.

Source: Author's calculations using the March Current Population Survey, 1981 
through 1999.
a.  In April of survey year 1984, sample weights based on the 1970 Census were 
replaced with sample weights based on the 1980 Census and the sample design was 
changed to increase the accuracy of state estimates.  In survey year 1994 there 
were several changes in the CPS.  It moved fully to computer-assisted survey 
interviews.  Sample weights based on the 1980 Census were replaced with sample 
weights based on the 1990 Census.  The Monthly Basic Survey was revised, and 
three new disability questions were added.  It is possible that these changes 
affected the measurement of the population with a disability either through 
changes in the sample weights or in the way respondents answered disability 
questions.

b.  Persons with a work limitation are defined as those who report having (or 
are reported by the household's respondent as having), at the time of the 
survey, "a health problem or disability which prevents them from working or 
which limits the kind or amount of work they can do."

c.  Persons with a work disability fall into one of the following categories, 
each of which is related to a question on the CPS: (1) they have a work 
limitation, (2) they did not work in the previous year because they were ill or 
disabled and unable to work, (3) they retired or left a job for health reasons, 
(4) they received veterans' benefits due to a service-contracted disability in 
the previous year, (5) they received workers' compensation benefits or other 
benefits in the previous year as a result of job-related injury or illness, (6) 
they received Supplemental Security Income benefits and were less than 65 years 
old in the previous year, and/or (7) they received Medicare and were less than 
65 years in the previous year.

d.  The percentage point difference in the prevalence of work disability minus 
the prevalence of work limitation.  The difference between the two measures is 
in part due to the fact that work limitation is reported at the time of the 
survey while many of the other categories of work disability are categories 
reported for the previous year.  For example, people may receive workers' 
compensation in the previous year and no longer have a work limitation at the 
time of the survey.
e.  The percentage change is the percentage point difference divided by the 
average of the two prevalences multiplied by 100.

Source: Author's calculations using the March Current Population Survey, 1981 
through 1999.
a.  Persons with a work limitation are defined as those who report having (or 
are reported by the household's respondent as having), at the time of the 
survey, "a health problem or disability which prevents them from working or 
which limits the kind or amount of work they can do."
b.  In April of survey year 1984, sample weights based on the 1970 Census were 
replaced with sample weights based on the 1980 Census and the sample design was 
changed to increase the accuracy of state estimates.  In survey year 1994 there 
were several changes in the CPS.  It moved fully to computer-assisted survey 
interviews.  Sample weights based on the 1980 Census were replaced with sample 
weights based on the 1990 Census.  The Monthly Basic Survey was revised, and 
three new disability questions were added.  It is possible that these changes 
affected the measurement of the population with a disability either through 
changes in the sample weights or in the way respondents answered disability 
questions.

Source: Author's calculations using the March Current Population Survey, 1981 
through 1999.

a.  Persons with a work limitation are defined as those who report having (or 
are reported by the household's respondent as having), at the time of the 
survey, "a health problem or disability which prevents them from working or 
which limits the kind or amount of work they can do."

b.  In April of survey year 1984, sample weights based on the 1970 Census were 
replaced with sample weights based on the 1980 Census and the sample design was 
changed to increase the accuracy of state estimates.  In survey year 1994 there 
were several changes in the CPS.  It moved fully to computer-assisted survey 
interviews.  Sample weights based on the 1980 Census were replaced with sample 
weights based on the 1990 Census.  The Monthly Basic Survey was revised, and 
three new disability questions were added.  It is possible that these changes 
affected the measurement of the population with a disability either through 
changes in the sample weights or in the way respondents answered disability 
questions.

c.  Looking at the percentages, some states appear to be tied and thus should 
have the same rank.  However, the rankings are based on three decimal places.  
There were no ties.

d.  The percentage change is the difference between the two averages divided by 
the average of the two averages multiplied by 100.  Double asterisks (**) note 
locations where the absolute change in the percentage with disabilities from 
period to period is statistically different from zero, assuming a 90 percent 
confidence level.

Source: Author's calculations using the March Current Population Survey, 1981 
through 1999.

a.  Persons with a work limitation are defined as those who report having (or 
are reported by the household's respondent as having), at the time of the 
survey, "a health problem or disability which prevents them from working or 
which limits the kind or amount of work they can do."

b.  In April of survey year 1984, sample weights based on the 1970 Census were 
replaced with sample weights based on the 1980 Census and the sample design was 
changed to increase the accuracy of state estimates.  In survey year 1994 there 
were several changes in the CPS.  It moved fully to computer-assisted survey 
interviews.  Sample weights based on the 1980 Census were replaced with sample 
weights based on the 1990 Census.  The Monthly Basic Survey was revised, and 
three new disability questions were added.  It is possible that these changes 
affected the measurement of the population with a disability either through 
changes in the sample weights or in the way respondents answered disability 
questions.

c.  Looking at the percentages, some states appear to be tied and thus should 
have the same rank.  However, the rankings are based on three decimal places.  
There were no ties.

d.  The percentage change is the difference between the two averages divided by 
the average of the two averages multiplied by 100.  Double asterisks (**) note 
locations where the absolute change in the percentage with disabilities from 
period to period is statistically different from zero, assuming a 90 percent 
confidence level.

Source: Author's calculations using the March Current Population Survey, 1981 
through 1999.

a.  Persons with a work disability fall into one of the following categories, 
each of which is related to a question on the CPS: (1) they have a work 
limitation, (2) they did not work in the previous year because they were ill or 
disabled and unable to work, (3) they retired or left a job for health reasons, 
(4) they received veterans' benefits due to a service-contracted disability in 
the previous year, (5) they received workers' compensation benefits or other 
benefits in the previous year as a result of job-related injury or illness, (6) 
they received Supplemental Security Income benefits and were less than 65 years 
old in the previous year, and/or (7) they received Medicare and were less than 
65 years in the previous year.

b.  In April of survey year 1984, sample weights based on the 1970 Census were 
replaced with sample weights based on the 1980 Census and the sample design was 
changed to increase the accuracy of state estimates.  In survey year 1994 there 
were several changes in the CPS.  It moved fully to computer-assisted survey 
interviews.  Sample weights based on the 1980 Census were replaced with sample 
weights based on the 1990 Census.  The Monthly Basic Survey was revised, and 
three new disability questions were added.  It is possible that these changes 
affected the measurement of the population with a disability either through 
changes in the sample weights or in the way respondents answered disability 
questions.

Source: Author's calculations using the March Current Population Survey, 1981 
through 1999.

a.  Persons with a work disability fall into one of the following categories, 
each of which is related to a question on the CPS: (1) they have a work 
limitation, (2) they did not work in the previous year because they were ill or 
disabled and unable to work, (3) they retired or left a job for health reasons, 
(4) they received veterans' benefits due to a service-contracted disability in 
the previous year, (5) they received workers' compensation benefits or other 
benefits in the previous year as a result of job-related injury or illness, (6) 
they received Supplemental Security Income benefits and were less than 65 years 
old in the previous year, and/or (7) they received Medicare and were less than 
65 years in the previous year.

b.  In April of survey year 1984, sample weights based on the 1970 Census were 
replaced with sample weights based on the 1980 Census and the sample design was 
changed to increase the accuracy of state estimates.  In survey year 1994 there 
were several changes in the CPS.  It moved fully to computer-assisted survey 
interviews.  Sample weights based on the 1980 Census were replaced with sample 
weights based on the 1990 Census.  The Monthly Basic Survey was revised, and 
three new disability questions were added.  It is possible that these changes 
affected the measurement of the population with a disability either through 
changes in the sample weights or in the way respondents answered disability 
questions.

c.  Looking at the percentages, some states appear to be tied and thus should 
have the same rank.  However, the rankings are based on three decimal places.  
There were no ties.

d.  The percentage change is the difference between the two averages divided by 
the average of the two averages multiplied by 100.  Asterisks (*) note locations 
where the absolute change in the percentage with disabilities from period to 
period is statistically different from zero, assuming a 90 percent confidence 
level.

Source: Author's calculations using the March Current Population Survey, 1981 
through 1999.

a.  These estimated populations are the denominators of the estimated 
percentages in Tables 1, 2, and 4.

b.  In April of survey year 1984, sample weights based on the 1970 Census were 
replaced with sample weights based on the 1980 Census and the sample design was 
changed to increase the accuracy of state estimates.  In survey year 1994 there 
were several changes in the CPS.  It moved fully to computer-assisted survey 
interviews.  Sample weights based on the 1980 Census were replaced with sample 
weights based on the 1990 Census.  The Monthly Basic Survey was revised, and 
three new disability questions were added.  It is possible that these changes 
affected the measurement of the population with a disability either through 
changes in the sample weights or in the way respondents answered disability 
questions.

through 1999.


a.  Persons with a work limitation are defined as those who report having (or 
are reported by the household's respondent as having), at the time of the 
survey, "a health problem or disability which prevents them from working or 
which limits the kind or amount of work they can do."

b.  In April of survey year 1984, sample weights based on the 1970 Census were 
replaced with sample weights based on the 1980 Census and the sample design was 
changed to increase the accuracy of state estimates.  In survey year 1994 there 
were several changes in the CPS.  It moved fully to computer-assisted survey 
interviews.  Sample weights based on the 1980 Census were replaced with sample 
weights based on the 1990 Census.  The Monthly Basic Survey was revised, and 
three new disability questions were added.  It is possible that these changes 
affected the measurement of the population with a disability either through 
changes in the sample weights or in the way respondents answered disability 
questions.

Source: Author's calculations using the March Current Population Survey, 1981 
through 1999.

a.  Persons with a work disability fall into one of the following categories, 
each of which is related to a question on the CPS: (1) they have a work 
limitation, (2) they did not work in the previous year because they were ill or 
disabled and unable to work, (3) they retired or left a job for health reasons, 
(4) they received veterans' benefits due to a service-contracted disability in 
the previous year, (5) they received workers' compensation benefits or other 
benefits in the previous year as a result of job-related injury or illness, (6) 
they received Supplemental Security Income benefits and were less than 65 years 
old in the previous year, and/or (7) they received Medicare and were less than 
65 years in the previous year.

b.  In April of survey year 1984, sample weights based on the 1970 Census were 
replaced with sample weights based on the 1980 Census and the sample design was 
changed to increase the accuracy of state estimates.  In survey year 1994 there 
were several changes in the CPS.  It moved fully to computer-assisted survey 
interviews.  Sample weights based on the 1980 Census were replaced with sample 
weights based on the 1990 Census.  The Monthly Basic Survey was revised, and 
three new disability questions were added.  It is possible that these changes 
affected the measurement of the population with a disability either through 
changes in the sample weights or in the way respondents answered disability 
questions.

a.  These sample size are the number of survey participants used to calculate 
the estimated percentages in Tables 1, 2, and 4.

b.  In April of survey year 1984, sample weights based on the 1970 Census were 
replaced with sample weights based on the 1980 Census and the sample design was 
changed to increase the accuracy of state estimates.  In survey year 1994 there 
were several changes in the CPS.  It moved fully to computer-assisted survey 
interviews.  Sample weights based on the 1980 Census were replaced with sample 
weights based on the 1990 Census.  The Monthly Basic Survey was revised, and 
three new disability questions were added.  It is possible that these changes 
affected the measurement of the population with a disability either through 
changes in the sample weights or in the way respondents answered disability 
questions.

through 1999.

a.  In the March CPS of any given year, approximately half of the households 
were surveyed the previous March, while the remaining households are eligible to 
be surveyed the following March.  These estimated correlation coefficients 
measure the degree to which a person's disability status in one year is related 
to their disability status in the next year.

b.  Persons with a work limitation are defined as those who report having or are 
reported by the household's respondent as having), at the time of the survey, "a 
health problem or disability which prevents them from working or which limits 
the kind or amount of work they can do."

c.  Persons with a work disability fall into one of the following categories, 
each of which is related to a question on the CPS: (1) they have a work 
limitation, (2) they did not work in the previous year because they were ill or 
disabled and unable to work, (3) they retired or left a job for health reasons, 
(4) they received veterans' benefits due to a service-contracted disability in 
the previous year, (5) they received workers' compensation benefits or other 
benefits in the previous year as a result of job-related injury or illness, (6) 
they received Supplemental Security Income benefits and were less than 65 years 
old in the previous year, and/or (7) they received Medicare and were less than 
65 years in the previous year.

d.  In April of survey year 1984, sample weights based on the 1970 Census were 
replaced with sample weights based on the 1980 Census and the sample design was 
changed to increase the accuracy of state estimates.  In survey year 1994 there 
were several changes in the CPS.  It moved fully to computer-assisted survey 
interviews.  Sample weights based on the 1980 Census were replaced with sample 
weights based on the 1990 Census.  The Monthly Basic Survey was revised, and 
three new disability questions were added.  It is possible that these changes 
affected the measurement of the population with a disability either through 
changes in the sample weights or in the way respondents answered disability 
questions.

e.  It is not possible to identify individuals who are in both the March 1985 
and March 1986 surveys; therefore estimated correlation coefficients for 1985 to 
1986 are not available.  A conservative proxy is the larger of the values form 
1984 to 1985 and 1986 to 1987.  This problem occurs for 1995 to 1996, as well.
