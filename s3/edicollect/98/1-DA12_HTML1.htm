<h1><a name="_Toc152742263">Abstract</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Internet improves access to employment and community
for many people. However, there is growing concern that many Web sites are
inaccessible to people with certain disabilities. This article examines the
impact on people with disabilities of online human resources processes used for
employee recruitment, benefits, and training. In 2002, Cornell University staff reviewed the accessibility of 10 Job boards and 31 corporate e-recruiting Web
sites. Human resource (HR) professionals are well positioned to report on key
issues regarding these processes. A survey of 433 HR representatives was
conducted regarding their organizations' use of information and Web technology
in HR processes; knowledge of computer/Web barriers to employees with
disabilities; and familiarity with assistive technology and resources. The
authors summarize current literature and legislation relevant to Web
accessibility, and discuss implications of their findings for businesses and
people with disabilities in the workplace. </p>

<h1><a name="_Toc152742264">Importance of the Problem</a></h1>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742265">Growth of the Internet and Computer Use</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Americans are buying computers and connecting to the
Internet in ever greater numbers. In the fall of 1998, there were about three
million World Wide Web sites available to Internet users. By early 2002, there
were nearly 40 million (Zakon, 2002). In December of 1998, 32.7% of individuals
aged three and older used the Internet; by September 2001, that percentage had
grown to 53.9% (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2002). As of April 2002, there
were 165 million Americans online -- nearly 60% of the population (Nua
Internet, 2002). By the following year, about 66% of the population had
Internet access, and that number climbed to 75% by February, 2004
(Nielsen/Netratings, 2004).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>This rapid growth in computer and Internet use has not
been the same for individuals with disabilities. A report by the U.S.
Department of Commerce (2002) found that 63.1% of people aged 25-60 without
disabilities had used the Internet, while people with disabilities in that age
range were much less likely to have accessed the Internet (ranging from 30.3%
of those with multiple disabilities to 54.8% of those who were deaf or had a
severe hearing impairment). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Kaye (2000) focused on those with access to a computer and
the Internet. He analyzed uses of the Internet by those aged 15 years and over,
with and without a work disability, using 1998 and 1999 Census Bureau data. For
the most part the use patterns of those with and without a disability were very
similar. The most common application was e-mail, used by seven out of 10 people
with disabilities. Six out of 10 searched for information, and four out of 10
used the Internet for news and weather information. About a third (29.3%) of
those with a work disability reported using the Internet for courses and
schoolwork, compared to 35.2% of those without a disability. Job-related tasks
were far less likely to be performed online by those with a disability 26.2% as
compared to 43.1% probably reflecting the fact they are less likely to be
employed. Interestingly, despite this, individuals with disabilities are just
as likely to use the Internet to search for jobs as those without disabilities
15.9% and 16.7% respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>An online poll by Harris Interactive (Taylor, 2000a) found
that the Internet can have a positive impact on adults with disabilities.
Adults with disabilities were more likely to report that the Internet had
significantly improved the quality of their lives than those without
disabilities (48% vs. 27%). Adults with disabilities were also more likely than
those without disabilities to report that the Internet helped them to be better
informed about the world (52% vs. 39%), feel connected to the world (44% vs.
38%), and reach out to people with similar interests and experiences (42% vs.
30%). This reported impact on individuals with disabilities underscores the
importance of ensuring Web accessibility to all, regardless of disability.
Internet access may help to counteract the findings of another Harris poll that
found that individuals with disabilities were more likely to feel isolated,
feel left out of their communities, and express a desire to participate more (Taylor, 2000b). These results further emphasize the importance of ensuring accessibility
to all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Businesses are also becoming increasingly network
intensive, both internally (intranets) and externally (Internet) (Schrage,
2000). A cross-sectional survey of 248 executives from larger companies was
recently performed by Towers Perrin (2001b). They found that 86% saw the
Internet as changing business practices and processes. Nearly half (48%) expect
that the Internet will result in a significant change. The Web's influence in
this area is not limited to large businesses. A survey performed at the Harvard Business School (Kanter, 2001) found that small (fewer than 100 employees) and
medium (100-500 employees) businesses matched or outpaced larger businesses in
the use of the Internet for internal operations such as training and receiving
employee feedback. At least a third of all companies surveyed used the Web for
each of the purposes asked about in the survey, ranging from attracting new
customers, to purchasing, to conducting online meetings. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Given these predictions and expectations, it is important
to examine the impact of the Internet on employees, specifically those with
particular disabilities; the impact of the Internet will likely depend on the
type and nature of the person's disability. For those with mobility related
impairments, many of these technologies may be enabling, allowing easy access
to information, contacts, and resources. However, these cutting-edge Web
applications also have the potential to be significant barriers for those who
have visual or hearing disabilities, or limited dexterity for
mousing/navigating, unless the applications are designed to be accessible.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742266">Web Accessibility is an Issue</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Although there is a great deal of literature on how to
make Web sites accessible, there are few published studies evaluating the
accessibility of existing sites. Most accessibility studies utilize automated
accessibility testing software such as Bobby v3.2. Bobby was developed by the
non-profit Center for Applied Technology (CAST) to analyze a Web page's
conformance to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Accessibility
Initiative (WAI) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. (Visit
www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ for a description of these guidelines). It is designed to
check for errors that cause accessibility concerns, and it generates a report
listing the type, number and the location where the error was detected.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A recent study examined the accessibility of more than
1,800 state and federal government Web sites, and found that 17% met standards
of accessibility. These standards included either Bobby approval (5%), W3C or
section 508 compliant (4%), or had a text version available or text labels for
their graphical images (8%) (West, 2001). Regarding commercial sites, Heller
(2001) states that very few companies have made their Web sites accessible, or
have even considered it, primarily due to concerns about the expense of doing
so. This concern about costs persists despite the fact that making a site
accessible is estimated to run about 1-2% of the entire site cost, according to
Kynn Bartlett, the director of the HTML Writers Guild's accessible Web
Authoring Resources and Education Center (Heller, 2001).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>One of the most comprehensive studies to date of Web
accessibility examined the 50-100 most visited Web sites in six categories:
overall most visited, clothing, international, jobs, college, and government
(Jackson-Sanborn, Odess-Harnish and Warren, 2001). Bobby v3.2 was used to
evaluate the first layer of each of these sites. The results discussed only
Bobby &quot;Priority 1&quot; errors, which CAST defines as problems that
&quot;seriously affect a page's usability by people with disabilities.&quot;
Priority 1 errors are often &quot;show stoppers&quot; issues that could prevent
some individuals with disabilities from being able to access information on the
site or proceed to other areas of a site. For example, if a link is illustrated
with an image only, and no alternative text is provided, a visitor using a
screenreader would not know where the link was pointed. Only 33% of sites
passed without Bobby's priority 1 error flags. The government sites performed
the best, with 60% passing without Priority 1 errors. Of the 100 most popular
sites on the Web, 85% were found to have Priority 1 accessibility errors. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742267">Legislation Relevant to Internet Accessibility</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Several major federal laws are applicable to Web
accessibility, including the ADA, Sections 501 and Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and in particular the following two pieces of
recent legislation:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:150%'>Section 508
     of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (1998), which requires Federal
     agencies' electronic and information technology to be accessible to people
     with disabilities, including employees and members of the public (see
     www/section508.gov/docs/508law.html); and </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:150%'>Section 255
     of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , which requires manufacturers of
     telecommunications equipment and providers of telecommunications services
     to ensure that such equipment and services are accessible to persons with
     disabilities, if readily achievable. The Federal Communications
     Commission's Report and Order implementing Section 255 was released in
     September 1999 (see www/fcc.gov/telecom.html). </li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoBodyText>These laws have begun to bring about improvements in
accessibility. In 1999 the National Federation for the Blind (NFB) filed suit
against America Online Inc. (AOL) based on the ADA's equal access provisions.
NFB used the ADA because AOL's service was not compatible with screen reader
software used by blind and visually impaired people that translates text to
speech. The NFB dropped their suit after AOL agreed to make its browser
software compatible with the screen reader software (Gibson, 2001). In the wake
of this suit, the IRS's e-filing partners HDVest Inc., Intuit Inc., and H &amp;
R Block have agreed to make their sites accessible. Some of the response to
these lawsuits in the popular business press has been quite negative,
emphasizing potential liability and frivolous lawsuits related to lack of
accessibility (Frezza, 2000; Olson, 2000; and Schrage, 2000). More recently,
the first U.S. federal court opinion on the applicability of the ADA to the Internet was issued (Access Now Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., 227 F. Supp. 2d
1317 [S.D.Fla.] [2002]) opining that the ADA does not apply to Web sites, as
they are not &quot;public accommodations&quot; covered under the law (National
Council on Disability, 2003). This decision is still on appeal, and National
Council on Disability (NCD) argues that the issue of what constitutes a
&quot;place&quot; of business must continue to be addressed in the courts and
through laws (2003).</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742268">Increasing Use of Web/Online Recruiting</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Recruiting qualified employees is a major concern for
businesses. The Internet has become one of the primary resources that companies
use to find employees. With millions of jobs and resumes available online the
&quot;Internet has become the most effective way to broadly disseminate
information about the availability of jobs and people&quot; (How online
recruiting changes the hiring game, 2001). Research by Goldman Sachs showed
that between the beginning of 1999 and November 2000, traffic to
career-oriented Web sites more than doubled, to 12.3 million unique visitors
per day (Rosenwald, 2000). A July 2001 poll of 400 recruiters by Recruiters
Network found that 78% felt Internet job postings were the most effective way
to spend job search budgets, far outstripping newspaper classifieds (12%) and
career fairs (7%) (Gill, 2001). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A January 2001 poll by the Society of Human Resource
Management (SHRM, 2001) supports these findings: Internet job postings were
used by 88% of human resource (HR) managers surveyed, just slightly less than
the proportion using personal contact/networking (95%), newspaper
advertisements (96%) and employee referrals (91%). Internet job postings came
in ahead of headhunters (74%), employment agencies (76%), and advertisements in
professional and trade journals (67%). The survey also asked about the
effectiveness of these different recruiting methods. The majority (58%) of the
respondents said that Internet job postings were an effective or extremely
effective method of search techniques, just slightly less effective than the
highest rated &quot;personal contact/networking&quot; (61%). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A survey of 150 hiring executives in the 1,000 largest U.S. firms found that nearly half (48%) preferred to receive resumes by e-mail, a
significant change from 1998 when only 4% had this preference (&quot;No Postage
Necessary&quot;, 2000). Dow Chemical has gone even further was issued they are
no longer accepting paper resumes for professional positions (estimated 1,500
people nationwide) and are recruiting all new salaried workers from their pool
of online candidates (Gill, 2001). A Towers-Perrin survey of 200 organizations
found that 98% offered or planned to offer, online job postings by the end of
2004, while 88% would offer online application for posted jobs by the end of
2004 (Towers-Perrin, 2003).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Job seekers have also turned to the Internet. A 1998 study
performed by J. Walter Thompson's Specialized Communications Group found that
70% of all active job seekers preferred the Internet to other methods and that
more than half the general public planned to use the Internet to find their
next job (Conhaim, 1998). The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)
search tactics poll (2001) found that 96% of job seekers surveyed had used
Internet job postings to look for a new job. While that is a very high
percentage, it is important to note that the job seekers polled had signed up
for the CareerJournal.com's Job Alert list, and were therefore more likely to
have used online job searching than a random sample of job seekers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Web recruiting technology allows an applicant's job hunt
to reach more widely than ever before, which can be a great benefit to someone
with a mobility disability. It also creates a concern regarding access for
minorities and people with disabilities, who are less likely to have a computer
and Internet access (Kaye, 2000). Only 18% of the 100 most heavily trafficked
recruiting sites were found to meet all Bobby Priority 1 requirements
(Jackson-Sanborn, Odess-Harnish, &amp; Warren, 2001). Given these results,
inaccessible Web-based recruiting presents a significant employment roadblock
for those who have disabilities that prevent them from using a primarily
visually-oriented, point and click environment. </p>

<h1><a name="_Toc152742269">Methodology</a></h1>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742270">Background of the Research Project</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>This article describes results from a Research and
Demonstration Project funded by the U.S. Department of Education National
Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) to the Cornell
University Employment and Disability Institute in the School of Industrial and Labor Relations-Extension Division, to study ways to improve the employment
practices covered by Title I of the ADA. The study was done in collaboration
with the Society for Human Resource Management, which is the world's largest
association devoted to human resource management and represents more than
175,000 individual members, the Washington Business Group on Health, and The
Lewin Group, a premier national health care and human services consulting firm
(www.lewin.com). This research began in 1998 with the original goal of
investigating the impact of the ADA on the employment practices of small,
medium, and large private sector businesses, in order to assist in the
identification of the greatest challenges to implementing the employment
provisions of the ADA, and to identify interventions that could address these
issues. Human resource (HR) professionals were selected as the informants for
this study, because of their critical role in workplace hiring and retention
processes. HR professionals are responsible for recruitment, pre-employment
screening, interviewing, and other workplace practices that affect the hiring
of workers with and without disabilities. Compensation, benefits, training,
performance management, and staff development are also often the responsibility
of the HR department. In this study, employment policy and practices that
enhance both the hiring and retention of workers with disabilities were
examined. Results of these inquiries assisted in the identification of progress
made in the implementation of the ADA in business organizations to date, and
remaining problem area and barriers to the employment and retention of people
with disabilities. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>While this research was in process, new technologies were
creating an emerging issue in workplace accessibility. The focus of the project
was therefore broadened to include a preliminary inquiry into employers' use of
IT in employment more generally, while still focusing on human resources
management processes and the accessibility of these services. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The first phase of the IT-related research was a review of
selected e-recruiting Web sites, and the second phase of the research was a
survey of HR professionals regarding their organizations' use of Web technology
in HR processes and computer accessibility issues in the workplace. In this
second phase of the research, we returned to survey those HR professionals who
were drawn from the SHRM membership who had been participants in the earlier
research examining disability nondiscrimination workplace policies and
practices and accommodation more broadly. We here give a brief review of the
first phase of the research, but will be focusing on the second phase of this
effort.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Ten job boards and 31 corporate e-recruiting Web sites
were evaluated for accessibility for people with disabilities. Job Boards are
defined as an Internet site where employers pay to post their positions and to
search the resume database for candidates. Candidates can search and apply
online for positions as well as post resumes for free. The examination of the
job boards and Web sites was performed using both an automated accessibility
testing software (Bobby v3.2) and an evaluation of a sub-sample of the sites
through a &quot;simulated&quot; application process. The simulated application
process was performed using only the information available to a screen reader
and navigating the site using only keyboard commands, duplicating how a blind
individual would navigate the Web. The purpose of this was to see if it would
be possible to successfully proceed through the entire multi-step job search
and application process.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>None of the job board pages (home, job search, signup, or
resume submittal pages) were found to be accessible according to Bobby
standards. The vast majority of corporate e-recruiting sites also failed
Bobby's tests. The simulated application process assessment was slightly more
promising, but only three of the nine job boards and three of the 12 corporate
sites evaluated were accessible enough to work through the entire process of
registration, job searching, resume submittal, and application for a position.
Many of the issues encountered could easily be corrected through the consistent
use of alternative text for essential submit image buttons (i.e.
&quot;apply&quot;, &quot;post resume”;) (Erikson, 2002). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Findings from this phase of the study contributed to the
second phase the survey of HR professionals, described in the remainder of this
paper.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742271">The Survey Instrument</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The survey was pilot tested on nearly two dozen Cornell
University HR professionals. It was then revised and retested to ensure the
clarity of the questions and validity of data collected. In addition to
gathering respondent and organizational characteristics, the survey
incorporated questions on the extent of computer use in the organization, scope
of online technologies applied to human resource processes, awareness of
potential barriers computers might present to people with specific
disabilities, knowledge of assistive technology and accessibility resources, as
well as familiarity with computer-related adaptations made for employees with
disabilities, availability of employees trained in computer accessibility,
helpfulness of organizational resources to address accessibility issues and
other types of resources/solutions. The final survey instrument took
approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742272">Sampling</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The sample for the 2002 survey consisted of the 813
members of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) who had
participated in the original 1998 survey. SHRM, the largest human resource
organization in the United States, was sampled with the assumption that this
would provide respondents who clearly identify themselves by interest and
function with the HR profession. The original SHRM survey sample was comprised
of 1,402 randomly selected SHRM members, chosen to provide a sample
representing small, medium, and large organizations in the U.S. (Brannick &amp; Bruyère, 1999). Choosing to survey the respondents from the 1998
survey may mean that results presented here are not reflective of the knowledge
of newer SHRM members, as our respondents were for the most part more seasoned
professionals. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742273">Data Collection and Analysis</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Announcement letters were sent to potential respondents in
May 2002. Data collection began 5 days later and was completed in July 2002.
All surveys were conducted by telephone using a CATI (computer-assisted
telephone interviewing) system. Hard copies of the survey were available to
respondents via e-mail and fax if requested. If the original respondent was no
longer with the company or otherwise unavailable, attempts were made to locate
an appropriate and/or equivalent informant within the company. A total of 493
individuals were successfully contacted, of whom 433 completed the survey (60
refused to participate), resulting in an 88 % response rate. Overall, 59 % of
the respondents had also participated in the 1998 survey. Most of the 320
original respondents, who were not resurveyed in 2002, had invalid phone
numbers, were no longer with the company, or unavailable for some other reason.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Basic descriptive statistics were generated for this
report. In addition, selected questions were further examined using specific
factors such as organization type, size, and whether the organization had
experienced making adaptations to a computer for an employee with a disability,
to explore the impact of these factors on responses. Chi-squared tests and
T-tests as appropriate were used for performing these comparisons. In cases
where low expected cell counts were encountered Fisher's exact test was used in
place of Chi-square test. The p&lt;.05 significance level was used throughout,
applying Bonferroni's adjustment procedure for multiple statistical tests
within issue categories where required to control for compounding
comparison-wise Type 1 error rates. Across all survey questions fewer than 4%
of respondents answered &quot;don't know/refused&quot; on average. Given this
small number, these responses have been excluded from the analysis presented in
this report.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742274">Respondent and Organization Characteristics</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Approximately one quarter (24 %) of the respondents were
from very large companies (those with more than 5,000 employees), a third (33
%) were from medium to large-sized companies (more than 500, but less than
5,000) and the remainder (43 %) were from smaller companies (those with fewer
than 500 employees).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The respondents represented a spectrum of industries as
well. Two in 5 were from service industries and 1 in 5 was in durable or
non-durable manufacturing. Together, finance and insurance represented 13 %, 7%
were high-tech industries, while public administration and
transportation/utilities each represented 6%, and companies in the retail/
wholesale trade made up 5 %.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc152742275">Survey Results</a></h1>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742276">Computer Use</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>One of the issues of interest was the extent of computer
use by employees of the respondents' companies. The majority of HR informants
in all industries reported that most of the company's employees used computers
at least part of the time. Fewer than 1 in 10 employees in finance, insurance
and high-tech/ computer/telecommunications do not use computers at all, and
fewer than 1 in 5 don't use computers in the public administration and service
industries. Only slightly more than a third of the workforces in the
manufacturing, transportation/utilities and retail/wholesale trade do not use
computers at all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>While the majority of the employees in the participants'
companies use computers, we also asked &quot;What percentage of existing
positions in your organization require using a computer more than half the
workday?&quot; Even in the industries with the lowest computer use
(transportation/utilities, manufacturing, and retail/wholesale trade), 2 out of
5 employees spend at least half the workday on computers. Three out of 5
positions in public administration and service industries use computers more
than half the day, and 4 out of 5 in the insurance, high tech and finance
sectors use computers this much.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742277">Use of Online Technology in HR Processes</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In order to determine the distribution of online
technologies in human resources within the sample, the survey included a
question asking about the use of four prominent online HR technologies (online
job postings, online benefits information dissemination, online benefits self
service, and online employee training). The majority of the respondents
reported their companies were using each of the four online technologies to
some extent. Overall, more than two-thirds reported using at least three of the
online technologies, with only 3% reporting not using any. Online job postings
were by far the most commonly used: nearly nine out of ten companies reported
using them, and nearly half (44 %) use them &quot;a great deal.&quot; Online
benefits information dissemination was also common, and was used by more than 4
out of 5 companies; one-quarter reported using it &quot;a great deal.&quot;
Online benefits self service where an employee can alter personal benefits
online was used by over half the companies, and was used a great deal by nearly
1 out of 5. The majority (63 %) of respondents also reported that their
companies made use of online training, but its use was not as intensive, with
only 4% reporting using it a great deal. Larger companies were significantly
more likely to use these HR technologies than smaller companies, and to use
them more heavily.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742278">Familiarity with Assistive Technologies</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The respondents were asked about how familiar they or
their staff were with six of the most common assistive technologies used to
adapt computers or information technology applications (screen magnifiers,
speech recognition software, video captioning, Braille readers/displays, screen
readers, guidelines for Web design). Nearly half (46 %) were familiar with
screen magnifiers, although nearly a third were unfamiliar with this
technology. Approximately a third reported familiarity with speech recognition
software. Video captioning was familiar to one out of four respondents, but was
unfamiliar to over half. Assistive technologies designed for blind individuals
were unfamiliar to the majority of respondents. Braille readers/displays were
familiar to only 1 in 5 respondents, while only 16 % of respondents were
familiar with screen readers. As would be expected, those who reported having
made computer adaptations for employees were more likely (in most cases, twice
as likely) to report familiarity with each of these technologies. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Overall, only 13 % of all respondents noted familiarity
with guidelines for accessible Web design, with those from larger organizations
(500+) more likely to report familiarity (17 % compared to 9%). Those with
experience adapting computers for accessibility were more than twice as likely
to be familiar than those without this experience (19 % compared to 7%).
Considering the number of organizations utilizing Web-based HR processes, this
low level of familiarity highlights an area of real concern.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Following up on this issue, respondents were queried about
their awareness of whether any of their organizations' HR Web sites had been
evaluated for accessibility for people with disabilities. Of those who had such
sites, only about 1 in 10 said they were aware of an evaluation, 2 of 5 said
their sites had not been evaluated, and slightly over half were unsure. Even
though those with experience adapting computers for accessibility were more
than twice as likely to report evaluating their Web sites for accessibility,
this still accounted for only 14 % of that sub-group, compared to 6% of those
without experience. Although the sample sizes by industry are small, it is
interesting to note that the public administration respondents were more likely
to say their sites had been evaluated (21 %) than those in other industries.
This may reflect a greater awareness of governmental legislation regarding
accessibility (i.e. Section 508).</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742279">Computer Adaptations Made for Employees with
Disabilities</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Despite the large number of respondents who were not very
familiar with accessibility issues, nearly half reported having made
alterations to make a computer accessible to an employee with a disability, and
only 1% reported being unable to accommodate. As might be expected, larger
companies were more likely to have made adaptations for employees with
disabilities, because they would be more likely to have a larger number of
employees with disabilities. Nearly three quarters (73%) of the largest
employers (5,000+ employees) had made adaptations, compared with six in 10
medium-large companies (500 to 4,999) and three in 10 small companies (less
than 500). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The single adaptation reported by nearly half of those
respondents who reported making accommodations was that of altering the
workstation. Making computer workstations accessible to employees using
wheelchairs (26%) was also common, but also smaller changes such as special
keyboard trays for individuals with carpal tunnel problems were mentioned.
Nearly two-thirds of the adaptations (65%) were for individuals with visual
impairments, and included screen magnifiers (41%), large screens (16%), screen
readers (8%) and Braille readers (6%). Special computer input apparatus such as
mice, keyboards and pointing devices were mentioned by almost a third (31%) of
those who had made adaptations. Voice recognition software was also mentioned
by 1 in 5 respondents.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742280">Perceived Barriers for Specific Disabilities</a> </h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Given the extensive amount of computer use in the
workplace reported, we examined how HR representatives viewed barriers posed by
Web/computer technology to individuals with different disabilities. Five
categories of disabilities were inquired about -- wheelchair users,
visually-impaired/ blind users, deaf users, fine motor limitations that
restrict use of keyboard or mouse, and cognitive or learning disabilities, and respondents
were asked how significant a barrier Web/computer technology would be for
individuals with each of these disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Only 2% saw wheelchair users as experiencing a significant
barrier when operating a computer, with a large majority (86%), viewing it as
&quot;not a barrier at all.&quot; At the other end of the scale, over a third
of respondents rated Web/computer technology as a very significant barrier for
people with visual impairments, and half considered it somewhat of a barrier.
The majority of respondents also saw those with fine motor limitations and
cognitive/ learning disabilities as encountering at least &quot;somewhat&quot;
of a barrier. Only 1 in 10 saw computer use as not presenting a barrier at all
to people with these disabilities. Interestingly, although fewer respondents
saw technology as presenting a very significant barrier to users who are deaf,
only about half rated it as &quot;not a barrier at all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Do companies who have introduced computer adaptations for
employees with disabilities in the past assess potential barriers differently?
To answer this question, the assessment of barriers by organizations reporting
having made computer adaptations for employees with disabilities was compared
with the organizations that had not done so. Respondents who had no experience
making adaptations were almost twice as likely, compared to those who had made
adaptations, to rate a visual impairment as a very significant barrier (47% and
27% respectively). They were also much more likely to judge fine motor limitations
(23% and 12%, respectively) and cognitive or learning disabilities (17% and
10%) as very significant barriers. These results suggest that the experience of
having made accommodations may have a positive effect on the attitudes held by
the respondents (HR professionals) regarding the ease or difficulty (or perhaps
knowledge of choices available) of adapting computers for employees with
disabilities. Assessment of the degree of the barriers did not differ by size
of the organization.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742281">Familiarity with Accessibility Resources</a></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The HR representatives were asked about their (or their
staffs') familiarity with five IT accessibility resources. If they were
familiar, they were asked whether or not the resources had been used by their
organization. Nearly half (44%) were not familiar with any of the five
resources asked about. The majority of the respondents had little knowledge of
any individual resource. The only resource that more than a third were familiar
with was disability specific organizations, and approximately 3 in 5 of those
familiar with them had actually used such an organization. One in 5 were
familiar with the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) and nearly three quarters of
those familiar had actually used it. The Job Accommodation Network (JAN) is a free
consulting service that provides information about job accommodations, the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the employability of people with
disabilities (janweb.icdi.wvu/). Slightly more than half of the 16% of those
familiar with vendors of accessible computer software/hardware had actually
used them as a resource. Respondents were least likely to be familiar with the
World Wide Web Consortium (WC3), which develops interoperable technologies
(specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the Web to its full
potential (www.w3.org), and the Clearinghouse for Information Technology
Accessibility (CITA), a part of the U.S. General Services Administration Office
of Government-wide Policy that has been charged with the task of educating federal
employees and building the infrastructure necessary to support Section 508
implementation (www.section508.gov) but, again, approximately half of those
familiar had actually used them as a resource.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Organizational size did have an impact on awareness of two
of the resources. Nearly a quarter of the respondents from the largest
organizations (5,000+) reported to be very familiar with JAN, compared with
less than 10 % of the other respondents. Eighty-six percent of those from the
largest organizations who were aware of JAN had actually used JAN's services.
Only a third of the smaller organizations (less than 500) were aware of
disability specific organizations, while nearly half of the largest organizations
(5,000+) were. Again, the largest organizations were much more likely to have
used this resource (73% compared to 45%).</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc152742282">Approaches to Remove Technology Barriers</a> </h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The respondents were asked to rate how helpful eight
specific resources would be in removing technology barriers for applicants or
employees with disabilities (training purchasing or procurement specialists in
Internet access issues for people with disabilities, print information on
Internet accessibility, telephone or e-mail expert consultation on Internet
accessibility, Web-based resources on Internet/computer accessibility, computer
training for potential employees with disabilities, uniform guidelines to make
Web-based employer processes accessible, trained technical staff within the organization,
or specific expertise or technical assistance on technology accessibility
issues in the organization). The majority of the respondents saw all of them as
potentially helpful. More than 7 out of 10 considered the following helpful:
specific expertise or technical assistance on technology accessibility issues
in your organization, trained technical staff within your organization, uniform
guidelines to make Web-based employer processes accessible, and computer
training for potential employees with disabilities. Interestingly, information
in the form of telephone or e-mail consultation on Internet accessibility and
print information was seen as slightly less helpful (66% and 61% respectively)
than Web-based resources on Internet/computer accessibility (70%). Also of
interest is that training purchasing or procurement specialists in Internet
access issues for people with disabilities was least often rated as helpful by
the respondents.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc152742283">Conclusions</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Results of this Cornell University research the Web site
review and the subsequent HR professionals' survey of online/Web use in human
resource processes illustrates the importance of making online recruitment and
other human resources processes accessible for persons with disabilities. The
majority of the HR representatives surveyed reported that online/Web HR
processes are used extensively by their organization, with only 3% reporting
not making use of these online technologies. Not surprisingly, larger companies
were more likely to use these technologies and to a greater degree than smaller
organizations. Many companies not using online HR technologies within their
organization expected to in the near future. Given that access to human
resource services are essential for all employees, the issue of potential barriers
for applicants and employees with disabilities is evident. These findings not
only have implications for people with disabilities, but also for the general
workforce, which is aging.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It is encouraging that the resource most often identified
as helpful in addressing computer/Web accessibility issues was the employee
with a disability him or herself. It is important that HR professionals or
other organizational personnel involved in the accommodation problem-solving
process interact directly with the individual with a disability, as that person
is often the most knowledgeable about his or her needs. Such an approach is
also consistent with the intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,
which calls for the accommodation process to be an informal interactive
problem-solving approach between employer and the individual with a disability.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It is also important to note that respondents indicated
that they were not aware of the many excellent resources on information
technology accommodations available. Organizations such as the Job
Accommodation Network (JAN), the World Wide Web (W3C) Consortium, and the
Center for Information Accessibility (CITA), which supports Section 508
implementation, must find additional or alternative ways to make their informational
services available to those addressing to workplace accommodation questions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The ADA requires employers to make reasonable
accommodations for applicants and employees with disabilities, and this
includes providing accessible computer technology. Employers should be aware of
barriers that computers can create, be familiar with the types of assistive
technologies available, receive training in Internet and computer
accessibility, understand the types of computer adaptations available, and know
about the resource organizations available to provide technical assistance. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>This research also illustrates how experience with
accommodations or workplace adaptations can lessen the likelihood that
disability will be perceived as a barrier. Therefore increasing the exposure of
human resource professionals and supervisors to IT and other workplace
accommodations for persons with disabilities may be very helpful. This can be
accomplished through training, or by sharing across organizations successful
stories of accommodation experiences. This consciousness raising can also be
accomplished more directly by providing exposure to persons with disabilities
through summer internships or mentoring programs for students with
disabilities. Such programs can go a long way in lessening perceived barriers
and/or ability limitations of persons with disabilities in the workplace, as
well as providing youth with disabilities with valuable real world learning
experiences.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In closing, as indicated by the results of this research,
some of the specific recommendations for lessening future workplace IT barriers
are as follows: increase the organization's specific expertise or technical
assistance on technology accessibility issues; train technical staff about
accessibility issues, promote uniform guidelines to make Web-based employer
processes accessible; and provide computer training for potential employees
with disabilities. Such proactive efforts toward removing technology barriers
will go far to reduce the likelihood that claims of IT accessibility
discrimination will occur.</p>
