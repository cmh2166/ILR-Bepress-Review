<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Executive Summary</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is the second of two white papers that have been
developed to help policy-makers, educators, human service agencies, students
and their families examine the benefits of applying person-centered planning as
a tool to facilitate transition planning and the development of the transition
components in the Individualized Education Program (<acronym title="I.E.P.">IEP</acronym>) with high school
students who have disabilities.&nbsp; These documents represent the work that was
conducted through nine DDPC grant-funded demonstration sites between 1998 and
2001. The project, Transition Technical Assistance and Support Program
(T-TASP), was developed to support school and community agency systems meet the
federal and state mandates to involve students in his or her own educational
process.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The first paper, <i>Infusing a Person-Centered Approach into
Transition Planning for Students with Developmental Disabilities</i> (2000),
identified the barriers present within and between systems of support for youth
as they transition from school to post-secondary endeavors and explored
opportunities to integrate person-centered processes within these systems.&nbsp;
This second paper takes a deeper look at the strategies, methods and approaches
that proved effective in supporting and/or sustaining person-centered student
involvement in the development and implementation of the <acronym title="I.E.P.">IEP</acronym>. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One of the intended outcomes of these papers is to reaffirm
the efforts and energy of the people who committed three years to learn,
develop and/or implement high quality transition services and supports as a
component of the <acronym title="I.E.P.">IEP</acronym> that increase the likelihood of success for youth with
disabilities. Members joined the project community through public high schools,
the Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES), independent living
centers and community-based organizations.&nbsp; Everyone within the project
community holds a core belief that student-driven, or person-centered
transition planning is a critical factor leading to the post-secondary success
of the young adults who participated in the pilot project as students facing
transition from school to community living, learning and earning.&nbsp; While this
paper provides information that supports the efficacy for using a
person-centered approach to developing an <acronym title="I.E.P.">IEP</acronym> based on the accomplishments
within the various project communities, as well as providing strategies and
recommendations for integrating this approach within existing systems, it also
serves as a reflection of how early we are on the journey that leaves no child
behind.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

provide
training and technical assistance to nine demonstration sites across
New York in support of person-centered transition planning processes
for students who have
been identified as having a disability.&nbsp; This paper is the second

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">During the period of 1998 - 2000 each of the nine
demonstration project sites within the Transition Technical Assistance and
Support Program (T-TASP) community received training and support in learning
and using an array of person-centered planning approaches to plan for and to
provide transition services and supports to students who have been identified
as having a developmental disability and to their families.&nbsp; The demonstration
sites were comprised of public high schools, Boards of Cooperative Educational
Services (BOCES), independent living centers, transition coordination sites and
community rehabilitation agencies.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The intent of the project was to build capacity within the
demonstration project sites to develop and implement transition-planning
processes that incorporated person-centered approaches within them.&nbsp; A
secondary focus for the project was to promote systems change by identifying
mechanisms, strategies and opportunities beyond the project period through
which partnerships and collaborations could be formed to insure the
continuation of services and supports that foster meaningful and active
transition planning processes with students as they move toward adulthood.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">T-TASP further postulated four key premises as the framework
for the design and delivery of transition services and supports throughout the
grant cycle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="1" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">In reference to federal and state legislation that
     transition services are designed as an outcome-oriented process that takes
     into account the student’s preferences and interests, (8NYCRR200.1(rr); 34
     CFR 3000.18). Toward that end an array of person-centered planning
     approaches must be used when assisting the student in identifying his or
     her post-school outcomes. </li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="2" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">In accordance with section 614 of IDEA, the formal
     planning process must reflect the student’s (and family) interests,
     skills, needs, preferences and abilities and facilitate the involvement
     and progress of the student in the general curriculum.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="3" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Varied new and traditional resources and supports must be
     sought, created and utilized to ensure the involvement and progress of the
     student in the general curriculum, including the use of related services
     to support and maximize the student’s opportunity for success and
     achievement in the general education classroom.</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Social Role Valorization</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Throughout history the design and provision of human
services for people who live with disabilities is fraught with attempts to
protect, cure and/or overcome the conditions or symptoms that are defined as
“disabling.”&nbsp; So much focus is placed on the condition and its subsequent cure
that is all encompassing for the person who harbors the disability and for
those who are in the business of creating and administering service programs.&nbsp;
It quite literally becomes life defining for people and has lead to the global
expectation and acceptance of an assumption that people who live with
disabilities need highly specialized services and supports so distinct and
foreign that they must be administered out of the mainstream of community
life.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Wolf Wolfensberger, (1998), articulated a concept for
examining societal perceptions of people who are considered to be disabled in
the context of service constructs that are developed in an effort to support
them.&nbsp; Wolfensberger’s theory depicts the correlation between the value one
holds in the eyes of society as the determining factor for one’s ultimate
treatment by the very same society.&nbsp; Therefore, if a person is deemed “less
valuable” by a culture or society, (due to circumstances such as disability,
class or social status, ethnicity, etc), then it is psychologically acceptable
to treat that person in ways that reflect the perception, i.e. low quality
housing options, poor schooling or no education at all, low paying/low status
employment, no employment, etc. Consequently, people can be (and are)
perpetually marginalized to the outskirts of society, and beyond. This,
according to Wolfensberger, is rational, acceptable and justifiable behavior
from the perspective of those who are on the “inside” of the society.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If we are to build communities that are genuinely inclusive
of all people, then this marginalizing behavior must stop.&nbsp; One of the ways to
stop the practice is to recognize where our actions either help or hinder the
acceptance of people into societies.&nbsp; Wolfensberger argues that a person who is
perceived to have devalued characteristics and conditions requires that extreme
effort must be directed to supporting that person in acquiring and experiencing
socially valued roles. His theory of social role valorization would serve as
the springboard to person-centered planning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Five Accomplishments – Person Centered Work
Principles</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">History has shown that designers and providers of
educational and human services have tremendous influence over the activities
that affect the day-to-day experiences and future prospects of the people,
families and communities that rely on them, (O’Brien, 1989).&nbsp; Their policies
and practices influence critical life-defining experiences including:</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Where a person lives, learns, earns and plays</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">What activities fill the person’s days</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Who the person gets to know and who gets to know the
     person</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Where and how the person belongs in the community</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The fundamental question that should be on the minds of any
person in the position of designing or delivering services and supports on
behalf of people who are requesting them is “<i>What are we working toward?</i>”&nbsp;
Are we invested in perpetuating the myths and stigmata that are currently
assigned to persons who hold the label(s) of various disabilities or are we
committed to achieving outcomes that are designed to enhance the quality of
life of people who are living with disabilities and to enrich our local
communities?&nbsp; To what extent do people who rely upon educational and human
services experience the following:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Community presence</u>: <i>the sharing of the ordinary
places that define community life</i><i><span style="font-family: Georgia;">.</span></i><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> </span>What community settings does the person use
regularly (daily, weekly, occasionally)?&nbsp; To which of these places does the
person go alone? As part of a group of two or three? As part of a larger
group?&nbsp; Does the person have any significant problem using any of these places?
What other community settings would it be in the person’s best interest to use,
or to use more independently? What would it take to increase the number of
community settings the person uses completely? (Consider changes in the
person’s skills, changes in available assistance, negotiating changes in the
setting or changes in service patterns).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Choice</u>:<b><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> </span></b><i>the
experience of autonomy both in small, everyday matters (e.g., what to eat or
what to wear) and in large, life-defining matters (e.g., with whom to live or
what sort of work to do)</i><i><span style="font-family: Georgia;">.</span></i><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> </span>What decisions are made regularly by the
person? What decisions are made for the person by others? For which of these
could decision making be transferred to the person himself or herself?&nbsp; What
are the person’s strongest interests and preferences that create their
uniqueness?&nbsp; What would it take to increase the number, variety, and importance
of the decisions the person makes?&nbsp; What would it take to increase other’s
knowledge of the person’s interests and preferences?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Competence</u>:<b><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> </span></b><i>the
opportunity to perform functional and meaningful activities with whatever level
or type of assistance is required</i><i><span style="font-family: Georgia;">.</span></i><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp; </span>What skills could the person develop that
would offer the most opportunity for increased presence, choice, respect and
participation?&nbsp; What strategies for instruction and assistance have been most effective
for the person?&nbsp; Are there more efficient strategies than instruction, such as
environmental modification or provision of additional personal assistance?&nbsp; Are
there any health-related threats to the person’s continuing development?&nbsp; How
can these be managed effectively with minimal disruption of good quality life
experiences? What would it take to increase the person’s competence in more
valued activities?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Respect</u>:<b><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> </span></b><i>having
a valued place among a network of people and valued roles in community life</i><i><span style="font-family: Georgia;">.</span></i><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp; </span>What
are the valued community roles the person occupies and what percentage of time
is spent in each?&nbsp; What community roles offer the person the best opportunity
to express individual gifts and talents?&nbsp; What would it take to increase the
amount of time the person spends in a valued community role?&nbsp; What images and
ideas about a desirable future are available to the person?&nbsp; Does the person
display any characteristics that reinforce stereotyped perceptions of people
with severe disabilities? (Consider the images projected by activities,
schedules, expectations, and the way the person is spoken to and about).&nbsp; What
would it take to decrease the stigma the person experiences?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Community participation</u>:<b>&nbsp; </b><i>the experience of
being part of a growing network of personal relationships that include close
friends.</i>&nbsp; With whom does the person spend the most time on a daily and
weekly basis?&nbsp; How many of these people are other clients/students in the same
program?&nbsp; How many of these people are program staff?&nbsp; How many are people with
apparent disabilities?&nbsp; Are there other important people in the person’s social
network with whom the person spends time occasionally?&nbsp; Who are the person’s
friends and allies?&nbsp; Who knows the person intimately?&nbsp; Who will act as an
advocate for his or her interests?&nbsp; What would it take to provide better
support for the person’s present network of relationships? What would it take
to develop more friends or allies?&nbsp; What would it take to increase the number
of non-disabled people, including age-peers, who know and spend time with the
person as an individual?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Simply put, the underlying values of community-based
supports foster opportunities and experiences that allow people to:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">

<p class="MsoNormal">Embedded in the functional assessment model are two methods
for conducting assessment activities. <i>Situational assessments</i> provide
the student the opportunity to experience the actual tasks and activities
associated with real work environments within the school environment and may
incorporate simulations of community environments. <i>Community-based
assessments</i> provide the same opportunity but use community work sites that
are found within the local labor market, preferably within the geographic
location in which the student has determined s/he wants to work.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>A Quick Look at Standards-Based Educational Reform</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Standards-based reform is the process through which a change
in the educational system is facilitated through the establishment of content
or performance outcomes that serve as exemplars of high-quality outcomes of the
education process.&nbsp; The intent behind the establishment of such standards and
the subsequent development of the curricula is to facilitate the student toward
the attainment of the standards.&nbsp; What generally follows is the development of
tests to measure the gap that does or does not exist between the student and
his or her acquisition of the outcomes identified within the standard,
(Wehmeyer, 2002).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There are at least three different models in which standards
can be applied or utilized:</p>

<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="1" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">systemic reform- determine what the content standard needs
     to be in order to a) define the curriculum and then b) to define what a
     student should learn in relation to this…a shoot first ask questions later
     approach and almost always includes high stakes testing.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">professional reform- focuses on the reformation of
     standards with the intent of enhancing the professionalism and competency
     of the teachers and professional staff…this is to guide how to implement
     assessment, curriculum and instructional practices with students.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">reform network model- pays attention to the contextual
     variables associated with learning, including involvement of families,
     community commitment to support education, and the culture and climate of
     the school…the school as seen as a unique organization and standards are
     used to provide direction while leaving room for individualization.</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Focusing for a moment on the second example of reform,
identified as the professional model of reform, Wehman (2001) noted examples of
the qualities of professional standards of curriculum that have been
recommended in support of inclusive education. The qualities are:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Authentic and meaningful: connecting to student lives</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Student-centered: based on the student’s interests,
     preferences, concerns and capacities</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Experiential: incorporating activities that are related to
     authentic, naturally occurring, real-world experiences</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Foster collaboration and positive relationships among
     students: allow students to develop problem-solving skills, social skills
     and communication skills from socially valued roles and positions</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Value partial participation: valuing the contributions of
     all students, even if some students are capable of only carrying out
     portions of skills or activities independently</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Chronologically and developmentally appropriate:
     age-appropriate materials and goals that are complementary to the
     students’ cognitive, affective, physical an communicative abilities over
     time</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Future-oriented: focusing on life beyond the classroom in
     the areas of living, learning, earning and loving</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Focused on self-determination: bases on student-driven,
     student-centered practices</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It is important to overlay the professional model with some
critical components that are designed to ensure student access to the general
curriculum.&nbsp; These components include </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="1" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Taking into account the students unique interests,
     preferences, support and learning needs and incorporates membership from
     people in the student’s life who know and who have a stake in the
     student’s progress and success,</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="2" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">The application of materials and curriculum that are part
     and parcel of the whole school community and which serve to sustain high
     quality standards and measures,</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="3" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Customizing the instructional activities to meet the
     student’s goals and objectives while simultaneously responding to his or
     her unique learning style,</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="4" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Access to additional support, service and/or program
     modifications to ensure that students can progress in the curriculum and,</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="5" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">A focus on the personal outcomes identified within the
     post-school outcome statements to be used as a measure of the programs
     effectiveness.</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Assuming that access to the general curriculum has been
attained there will most likely be a need to incorporate modifications in the
teaching of the curriculum.&nbsp; These adaptations or modifications should be made
by initially evaluating the curriculum against the identified learning
objectives for the entire class and then identifying the specific learning
objectives for the student.&nbsp; A planning form developed by Schumm, Vaughn and
Leavell, (1994) provides an excellent framework for identifying the
materials/resources; instructional strategies/adaptations; and
evaluation/products needed for each level of student within a “planning pyramid”
(pp 608-615).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

all students should learn</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Modifications, adaptation and/or accommodations may then be
selected and tailored to the student based upon the student’s specific
strengths, interests and needs.&nbsp; This allows teachers to set different goals
and objectives for the student while allowing the student to participate in the
same academic activity with her or his classmates (Wehmeyer, 2002). </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, educational learning standards must be open enough
to allow the inclusion of career planning and development for all students. It
is through the opening of the standards via professional education reform and
an acceptance of both traditional and alternative (i.e. performance-based)
outcome measures that a high level of inclusive learning can take place.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoFooter"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Educators are faced with the challenge of helping students
who have disabilities identify long-term adult outcomes and then assessing
progress made toward achieving the stated outcomes, all the while struggling to
find the connection between this and the general education curriculum/learning
standards. Transition assessment, if done as IDEA intended and explicitly
expressed, with an emphasis on career planning and development and coupled with
person-centered approaches may serve as the fulcrum upon which the balance
between meeting the learning standards of general education and the development
of individualized educational programs might be made. The learning standards
within the core curriculum however, must be expanded in order to include all of
the school’s students. The development of alternate assessment formats was
established in order to facilitate this process.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If the purpose of any good assessment is to look at the
student’s growth in knowledge, understanding and ability to apply that
knowledge within specifically identified educational goals, (rather than
teaching students how to pass a test), then including students with
disabilities in the general curriculum does not mean that there is a need to
lower the learning standards.&nbsp; In fact, it quite optimistically looks at
raising the academic “bar” for all students.&nbsp; This so-called bar raising would
require a move away from the high stakes testing educational reform toward a
different approach to educational reform.&nbsp; The professional model of
educational reform (Wehmeyer, 2002) is an alternative approach that guides the
learning process across a series of quality standards within broadly defined
frameworks that are closely aligned with the fundamental values of
person-centered practices and which when combined may increase the likelihood
of creating successful, inclusive classrooms.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Providing Modifications, Adaptations and/or
Accommodations within the General Education Curriculum</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Adaptations to teaching within the general education
curriculum to students with cognitive disabilities need to be a considerate,
expected and accepted part of the teaching process.&nbsp; When developing
adaptations and modifications it is important to frame the adaptations,
modifications and accommodations within the context of developing useful and
essential skills all the while preserving the dignity and positive reputation
of the student for whom the adaptation is being made.&nbsp; Does the adaptation
allow the student to use the same materials that the other students are using?&nbsp;
Does it build upon an existing skill exhibited by the student?&nbsp; Does it
introduce and/or reinforce the learning of a new and relevant skill?&nbsp; Does the
adaptation allow the student to work with an increased level of independence or
does it rely primarily on the efforts of someone other than the student?&nbsp; Will
the adaptation be effective across environments?&nbsp; Is the adaptation easy for
the student to learn and use? </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There are at least four ways that access to the general
curriculum standards can be achieved.&nbsp; Through demonstrating the actual
explicit standard without any modification; through utilizing an alternate
response format to demonstrate acquisition of the standard; through the
determination of the critical function of the standard so that modifications
can be made to meet the same outcome intended within the original standard and;
through critical access skills (Kearns, 2001) in which the student works on
very basic skills that are embedded in the standards-based activities.&nbsp;
Determining which approach will increase the likelihood of success for any
given student relies on knowing and understanding each student from a person-centered
or student-driven perspective.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The key to accessing general curriculum standards for any
student regardless of ability level is to design activities that provide the
instructional foundation upon which real life can be built (Kearns, 2001).
Instruction has to have value and meaning for the student in order for learning
to take place.&nbsp; This means creatively incorporating the goals and objectives
stated in the student’s <acronym title="I.E.P.">IEP</acronym> to align as closely as possible to the
instructional activities occurring within the general education classroom
during those times when a student may not be able to do these activities, even
with adaptations so that the learning has value and meaning and can be applied
in present and future settings. It means developing academic content that
supports the same outcome standard (i.e. career development) for all students.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Career education programs typically found in general
education have the potential for being synonymous with the transition programs
typically found in special education if the instructional methods are
customized to each and every student in the school.&nbsp; This requires a commitment
to building a learning environment that is inclusive of all students, with and
without disabilities in a collaborative approach to the education process.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The main goal of cooperative learning, as described in the
Next S.T.E.P. guidebook (1997), is to create an environment in which students
who have divergent learning abilities work along side one another to achieve
group goals. Groups are structured in ways that support active participation of
all members and to accommodate the personalities and learning style preferences
of the students.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Elements embedded in inclusive classrooms include: peer
tutoring, focus on areas of interest, complementary group composition,
meaningful content of assignment, and a focus on student abilities and gifts.&nbsp;
Meaningful tasks and activities can and should be successfully developed and
implemented to support inclusive learning environments for all students. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The following table was developed to show one example of how
educational activities can be developed and effectively implemented with a
group of diverse learners.&nbsp; The exercises consisted of a series of activities
that were conducted during a professional development seminar for professional
education staff that were interested in learning more about person-centered
transition planning.&nbsp; Each activity included a set of instructions and the appropriate
tools to complete the activity.&nbsp; For example, the exercise called “interview”
required members to work in dyads and use a structured format for extracting
information related to each other’s preferences, abilities and interests.&nbsp; The
partners then took turns introducing one another to the larger learning
community highlighting the positive characteristics and traits represented by
the person.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Each activity the group engaged in throughout the seminar
was correlated to one or more of the New York State learning standards. Each
activity could easily be conducted as a classroom activity. All of the
activities convert to assessment tools effective in gathering information that
reflects the individual interests, skills, abilities and support needs of each
participant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On January 8, 2002, President George W. Bush signed into law
H.R.1, the No Child Left Behind Act (<a href="http://www.ed.gov/offices/OESE/esea">www.ed.gov/offices/OESE/esea</a>).&nbsp;
The intent of the law is to raise the standard for academic achievement for all
students and to improve public schools.&nbsp; Schools across the nation are now
being asked to use annual statewide assessments and show the progress that is
being made toward narrowing the achievement gap and schools across the nation
have responded through widespread education reform.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The law reflects four key components of education reform:
accountability and testing, flexibility and local control, funding for what
works, and expanded parent options (Committee on Education and the Workforce,
2002). Schools are required to “raise the bar” slowly but surely and to provide
measurable objectives for all children and for specific groups.&nbsp; Many schools
have risen to the challenge by adopting practices of education reform that lead
to high stakes testing and narrowly defined education standards.&nbsp; This
threatens to deepen the achievement gap that already exists between students
who are classified as disabled and/or students who economically disadvantaged
and their non-disabled or more affluent peers. &nbsp;Traditional segregated learning
environments continue to be utilized as “least restrictive” in light of the
increased demands on students to achieve higher academic test scores.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Standard-based reform is certainly one option that has
proven effective in raising the academic scores of students, but it is
potentially limited in its ability to increase the likelihood of success for
students beyond the walls of the elementary and secondary educational
settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Professional-based reform focuses on improving the academic and
skill-based performance of all students in relationship to their post-school
aspirations while concentrating on building on the skills of the teaching
professionals.&nbsp; Professional and reform network models of reform may assist in
building a stronger national workforce by building upon the skills, interests
and potential of each and every student.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It is important to know what a student is interested in and
hopes to achieve in life.&nbsp; Varied and creative approaches to assessing the
student’s interests and needs are critical to building a solid educational and
experiential foundation upon which students can make educated and informed
decisions, build competency and meet high standards of achievement. Studies
must be undertaken and research must be conducted that focuses on the effects
of including all students in school curriculum and experiences that integrate
person-centered principles while meeting high academic learning standards.
Educational learning standards must be broad enough to allow every child into
the mainstream of learning, earning and living so that every child has the same
opportunity to enter adulthood as contributing citizens within the communities
of our nation.&nbsp; </p>
