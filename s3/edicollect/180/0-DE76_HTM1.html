<h2>About the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Disability Demographics and Statistics</h2> 
<p> 
The Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Disability Demographics and Statistics (StatsRRTC) bridges the divide between the sources of disability data and the users of disability statistics. We conduct research exploring the reliability of existing data sources and collection methods, and study the potential to improve current and future data collection efforts.  
</p> 
<p>
The StatsRRTC is an interdisciplinary effort of three organizations at Cornell University: the Employment and Disability Institute, the Department of Policy Analysis and Management, and the Institute for Policy Research in Washington, DC. In addition, expertise is drawn from the following collaborating institutions: American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), Center for an Accessible Society, InfoUse, Institute for Matching Person and Technology, Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., and The Urban Institute.

The Annual Disability Status Reports: Introduction
</h2>
<p>
The Annual Disability Status Reports provide policy makers, disability advocates, reporters, and the public with a summary of the most recent demographic and economic statistics on the working-age (ages 21-64) population with disabilities. They contain information on the population size, prevalence, employment, earnings, poverty, household income, home ownership, and activity limitations of working-age people with disabilities, as well as the composition of this population by age, race, gender, and educational attainment. Comparisons are made to working-age people without disabilities, across types of disabilities, and to the previous year. Additional statistics by state are available at www.DisabilityStatistics.org.
</p>
<p>
The Status Reports look at the working-age population (21-64) because the employment gap between people with and without disabilities is a major focus of government programming and advocacy efforts.  Furthermore, employment is a key factor in the social integration and economic self-sufficiency of working-age people with disabilities.  Future Status Reports will address the school- and retirement-age populations and eventually expand to education and health-related issues.
</p>
<p>The estimates in the 2004 Status Reports are based on American Community Survey (ACS) data-a survey of the U.S. Census Bureau designed to replace the decennial census long form. In future years, we hope to add information derived from other data sources, such as the Current Population Survey (CPS) and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). See ACS User Guide on our web site, www.DisabilityStatistics.org for additional disability-related information in the ACS. A Census Bureau report, www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p60-226.pdf, provides a broader discussion of the ACS.</p>
<p>
The estimates in these reports are based on responses from a sample of the population and may differ from actual values because of sampling variability or other factors. As a result, apparent differences between the estimates for two or more groups may not be statistically significant. Asterisks (*) indicate whether increases and decreases are statistically significant at the 90-percent confidence level.

<strong>Definition of Poverty:  </strong>
The poverty measure is computed based upon the standards defined in Directive 14 from the Office of Management and Budget.  These standards use poverty thresholds created in 1982 and index these thresholds to 2003 dollars using poverty factors based upon the Consumer Price Index.  They use the family as the income sharing unit and family income is the sum of total income from each family member living in the household.  The poverty threshold depends upon the size of the family; the age of the householder; and the number of related children under the age of 18.

<strong>Definition of Employment: </strong>
A person is considered employed if he or she (a) worked as a paid employee, worked in his or her own business or profession, worked on his or her own farm, or worked 15 or more hours as an unpaid worker on a family farm or business, or (b) had a job but temporarily did not work at that job during the reference period due to illness, bad weather, industrial dispute, vacation or other personal reasons. The reference period is defined as the week preceding the date the questionnaire was completed.

<h2>Prevalence Time Trends</h2> 
<p> 
This Status Report addresses the time trend in the percentage of working-age (ages 21-64) people with sensory, physical, mental, and/or self-care disabilities in the United States, using data from the 2001-2004 American Community Surveys (ACS). (We report time trends for this group, and not for overall disability, because substantial respondent error was found in the go-outside-home and employment disabilities data from the 2001-2004 ACS.) State-level Status Reports and more information about the ACS are available at <a href="http://www.DisabilityStatistics.org">www.DisabilityStatistics.org</a>. 
</p> 
<ul>
	<li>The percentage of working-age people with sensory, physical, mental, and/or self-care disabilities increased* from 10.6 percent in 2001 to 10.9 percent in 2004, in the US.</li>
	<li>In other words, in 2004, 18316000 of the 167902000 working-age individuals reported sensory, physical, mental, and/or self-care disabilities, as compared to 17167000 of the 161247000 working-age individuals in 2001, in the US.</li>
</ul>
<p>
[Chart 1] This chart shows the estimated prevalence rates for working age people with sensory, physical, mental, and/or self-care disabilities over time from 2001 to 2004. The chart contains a column for each year. The estimated prevalence rate for working age people with sensory, physical, mental, and/or self-care disabilities for  2001: 10.6%, 2002: 10.9%, 2003: 10.8%, 2004:  10.9%. [End Chart 1]</p>
<p>
Definition of Disability:  In this status report we utilize four ACS disability types based on the following questions: (1) Does this person have any of the following long-lasting conditions: (a) blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing impairment? and (b) a condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical activities such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying?  (2) Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting 6 months or more, does this person have any difficulty in doing any of the following activities: (a) learning, remembering, or concentrating? and (b) dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home?
