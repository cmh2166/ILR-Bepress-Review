<p align="center"><strong><big><big><big>SSI'S INCOME AND RESOURCE RULES PART II:</big></big></big><br>
<big><big><big>A PRACTICAL APPLICATION</big></big></big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to thank our
readers who sent us questions about the SSI income and resource rules discussed in our
most recent, Winter 2004-05 newsletter. This follow-up article will give our readers some
more practical examples of how these rules play out in real life situations. We will use a
hypothetical person, Maria, and walk through a brief period of her life. We will see how
certain events - - the death of a spouse, receiving help from a sister, selling some of
her possessions, and going to work - - affect her eligibility for SSI and the amount of
the check she will get.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One wrinkle on SSI's
treatment of income is the <i>Retrospective Monthly Accounting (RMA)</i> system. Under RMA
rules, income received in a month is generally used to determine SSI eligibility and
payment amount two months later. We did not go into RMA rules in the previous newsletter
and we will not discuss them in any detail in our analysis of the issues below. Although
we talk about events that occur in 2005 and 2006, we will use the 2005 SSI rates
throughout the article. In reality, we can expect a slight cost-of-living increase to the
SSI rates in 2006.</p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>INTRODUCING MARIA</strong></big></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria, who is now 50 years
old, qualified for SSI benefits in 1995 based on an anxiety disorder. It is January 2005
and Maria is married to Hector. The couple has been married for more than 15 years. They
reside in a small, one-bedroom apartment which costs them $400 per month including
utilities. Hector, who is also 50, worked for years as a janitor until a disabling illness
forced him to stop work in late 2004. Hector currently receives New York State disability
payments of $300 per month and is considering an application for Social Security
Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Maria's SSI payment
amount, January 2005.</strong> Since Maria resides with Hector, her SSI check will be
based on New York's 2005 &quot;living with others&quot; rate of $602 per month. And, since
Hector's monthly income of $300 is so low, Maria will get the full $602 SSI amount per
month. Maria will also be eligible for Medicaid since SSI recipients in New York are
automatically eligible for Medicaid. Medicaid is important to Maria as it pays for her
psychiatrist, counselor, and prescription drugs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on SSI's formula for
deeming of income from a spouse, Hector's monthly unearned income would begin to count
against Maria's payment rate once it exceeds $310 per month. If Hector's unearned income
from state disability payments exceeded $935 per month, Maria would not be eligible for an
SSI check.</p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>HECTOR'S DEATH</strong></big></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late January 2005,
Hector dies from his illness. Shortly thereafter, on January 31, 2005, Maria goes to the
Social Security Administration (SSA) and reports her husband's death. SSA personnel assist
Maria in filling out an application for Social Security Widow's Benefits, based on her
disability, and have her complete an SSI form to report that she is now living alone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2005, Maria is
notified by SSA that she will be eligible for SSDI benefits as a disabled widow based on
her January 2005 application. After the mandatory five-month waiting period, Maria will
receive her first SSDI check in July 2005. The SSDI payment amount will be $357 per month.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Maria's SSI payment
amount, February 2005.</strong> Effective February, Maria is now living alone and will be
paid SSI based on the living alone rate of $666 per month. Since Maria has no other
income, earned or unearned, she will be paid the full $666 per month. Knowing that she
will face a challenge in paying her rent, without Hector's additional income, we should
refer her to a program like the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program for possible help
with her rent payments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Maria's SSI payment
amount, July 2005.</strong> Maria is still living alone, meaning her SSI payment will be
based on the living alone rate of $666 per month. However, now she qualifies for an SSDI
check of $357 per month. The SSI program will disregard the first $20 of the SSDI as a
general income exclusion ($357 - 20) and she will have $337 in countable income. Deducting
this from the SSI base rate ($666 - 337), her new SSI amount will be $329 per month and
she will still qualify for automatic Medicaid. Because of the $20 general income
exclusion, her combined income ($686) is now $20 more than the $666 SSI amount she was
getting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;A word about
Medicare</strong>.An individual qualifies for Medicare after receiving SSDI benefits for
two years (i.e., after a 24 month waiting period). In Maria's case, she would be eligible
for Medicare in July 2007: Part A (hospital insurance benefits) would be automatic and
cost-free, while Part B (supplemental medical insurance) would be optional and subject to
a monthly premium. (In all likelihood, the Medicaid agency will be able to pay for the
Part B premium under the Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries or QMB program.) When she
qualifies for Medicare in 2007, she will then be required to have her prescription drugs
paid for through the Medicare Part D program which starts in January 2006. (The Part D
program is beyond the scope of this newsletter but will be covered in a later issue of the
<i>Benefits Planner</i>.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>MARIA GETS HELP FROM HER SISTER</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is October 2005 and
Maria continues to receive $357 in SSDI benefits and an SSI supplement of $329 as we
calculated above. It is the 25<sup>th</sup> of October and Maria has run out of money and
is nearly out of food. Her sister, Katherine, decides to help out. She takes Maria to the
grocery store and pays for $35 worth of groceries for Maria. After delivering the
groceries to Maria's apartment, Katherine hands her $20 to &quot;help out&quot; and picks
up Maria's overdue phone bill saying she will send in a check covering the $28 bill
tomorrow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we analyze how each of
these transactions or gifts from Katherine will be treated by the SSI program, we will go
through a two-step analysis. First, we will determine if the help that Maria received
meets the definition of income. Second, assuming that the gift can be treated as income,
we will then determine whether any part of it can be ignored under SSI's income exclusion
rules.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Will the $35
payment for groceries affect Maria's SSI?</strong> If we assume that the groceries are all
food, the $35 worth of groceries will be considered &quot;in-kind income&quot; and will be
used to reduce her SSI check unless all or part of their value can be excluded. (Remember,
income is anything received in cash or in kind that can be used to meet needs for food or
shelter.) It will also be considered unearned income.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if $15 worth of the
groceries consisted of toilet paper, dish washing liquid, tooth paste, shampoo, and
laundry soap? Since this is not food or shelter, it will not be treated as unearned
income. Now, only the $20 worth of food will be potentially counted as unearned income.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any exclusions to
apply to the $35 or $20 worth of food? First, let's assume all $35 worth of groceries is
food. Until recently the exclusion rules would only allow Maria to exclude the first $20
of the $35 value. Up to $20 of unearned income was excluded in a month if it was received
on an irregular or infrequent basis. With $20 disregarded, the remaining $15 value of the
food would be counted. However, the new SSI income rules, effective April 1, 2005, exclude
irregular or infrequent unearned income of up to $60 per quarter. Therefore, if Maria has
no other income (other than her SSDI check) and Katherine doesn't start &quot;making a
habit&quot; of giving her food, all $35 worth of food will be excluded as irregular
in-kind income.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Will the $20 cash
gift affect Maria's SSI?</strong> This $20 cash gift will be considered unearned income.
Can it be excluded? Under the old rules, none would be excluded since the $20 unearned
income disregard, for income received on an irregular basis, was already applied to the
free food (see above). However, under the new SSI income rules, one could argue it is all
part of the same unearned income received on an irregular or infrequent basis, and subject
to the $60 per quarter exclusion. Therefore, none of the additional $20 cash would be
counted against her SSI benefits.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Will the payment of
Maria's phone bill affect her SSI?</strong> The $28 payment for Maria's phone bill will
not be treated as income to her and will not affect her SSI check. This is because this
payment does not meet SSI's definition of in-kind income (i.e., something other than cash
that can be used to meet her needs for food or shelter). This also falls into what SSI
calls &quot;non-income items,&quot; as bills paid to a third party for something other
than food or shelter.</p>

<p><i>How will all this affect Maria's SSI check?</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the old rules, Maria
would have had $392 in unearned income: $357 SSDI benefits; $15 in donated food ($35 - 20
irregular income deduction); and $20 in donated cash. The first $20 of the $392 would have
been disregarded, leaving $372 in countable unearned income. That would have been deducted
from the SSI rate of $666 (living alone) and the SSI check would have been $294 for that
month. Under the new rules, there will be no impact on her SSI benefits because the
combined food ($35) and cash gift ($20) fall within the $60 per quarter for income
received on an irregular or infrequent basis. Maria will continue to get a $329 SSI check
and automatic Medicaid.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>KATHERINE'S GIFT OF A SOFA; MARIA'S GARAGE SALE</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now November 2005 and
Katherine gives Maria a new sofa, worth $320, to replace her well-worn sofa. Maria decides
to have a garage sale to sell the old sofa, some used clothing that no longer fits her,
and some other household items which she no longer uses. She does very well at the garage
sale and takes in $245. She uses the $245 to pay two neighborhood kids $10 each for
helping her with the sale; spends $8 for a felt picture of Elvis that is sold by a
neighbor in her garage sale; and uses the remaining money ($217) to purchase badly needed
clothing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Will the gift of
the sofa affect Maria's SSI?</strong> The gift of the sofa will not be treated as income
to Maria and will not affect her SSI. This is because this payment does not meet SSI's
definition of in-kind income (i.e., something other than cash that can be used to meet her
needs for food or shelter). This also falls into what SSI calls &quot;non-income
items,&quot; as bills paid to a third party for something other than food or shelter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Will the proceeds
from the garage sale affect her SSI?</strong> The proceeds will not be treated as income
to Maria and will not affect her SSI. The money received for the sale or replacement of a
resource (in this case, the sale of used furniture, clothing, and household items) is not
counted as income. One resource has just been exchanged for another form of resource, in
this case for money.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $217 that remains from
the proceeds of the garage sale will count toward SSI's $2,000 resource limit for one
person. So long as the $217 combined with other non-exempt resources remains at or below
$2,000, Maria's SSI eligibility would not be affected.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The felt picture of Elvis
will not count as a resource, even if it is worth a bit more than the $8 Maria paid for
it. A picture will be classified under household goods or personal effects. As of April 1,
2005, the SSI program will no longer place a dollar limit on the value of household goods
and personal effects (the limit had been $1,500). So long as the Elvis picture is not some
expensive collectible that Maria is holding as an investment, she need not worry about it
affecting her SSI eligibility.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What if Katherine
accompanied Maria to the clothing store and paid for the $217 in clothing? Will the free
clothing affect Maria's SSI checks?</strong> If Katherine provides Maria with free
clothing, there will be no effect on Maria's SSI benefits. This is because under the new
income rules, SSI no longer considers clothing as a form of in-kind income. Again,
effective April 1, 2005, the SSI program only considers food and shelter in its definition
of income.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>INHERITANCE FROM AUNT SUSIE</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria's Aunt Susie died
during 2005. In her will she left her 2003 Ford Taurus to Maria, but did not leave her any
money or any other items. Susie's will left $14,000 to Katherine. A note, signed by Aunt
Susie but not an enforceable part of the will, was delivered to Katherine, following
Susie's death, saying that part of the $14,000 should be used to pay for Maria's car
insurance on the 2003 Taurus for one year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following probate of the
will, Maria receives title to the 2003 Taurus in December 2005. The fair market value of
the car is $14,000. Katherine also receives her inheritance of $14,000 the same month and
uses $1,200 of that money to directly pay an insurance company for the first year's worth
of insurance premiums for Maria's Taurus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Will the receipt of
the Taurus affect Maria's SSI?</strong> The car meets SSI's definition of a resource. It
is personal property owned by Maria that she could convert to cash which could be used to
provide for food or shelter. Under the old pre-April 1, 2005 rules, the car could have
been fully excluded (not counted against the $2,000 resource limit) if used to travel to
medical appointments, to travel to work, or if specially modified to accommodate a
disability. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new rules, the
auto will still meet the definition of a resource. However, effective April 1, 2005, one
auto will be excluded, if it is used for the transportation needs of the person on SSI or
a family member. This means that the Ford Taurus will not affect Maria's SSI eligibility
even if she does not need it to travel to work or to medical appointments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Will Katherine's
payment for the insurance affect Maria's SSI?</strong> Katherine's payment for the
insurance will not be treated as income to Maria and will not affect her SSI. This is
because this payment does not meet SSI's definition of in-kind income (i.e., it cannot be
used to meet her needs for food or shelter). This also falls into what SSI calls
&quot;non-income items,&quot; as bills paid to a third party for something other than food
or shelter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What if, instead of
receiving the Taurus, Maria received $14,000 as an inheritance and promptly went out and
bought a Taurus with the money?</strong> If Maria received the $14,000 outright, it would
be treated as income in the month of receipt and a resource in later months. Maria would
lose her SSI for at least one month. If she immediately spent the entire $14,000 on a car,
we then need to look at the analysis above. As long as the full value of the car is
treated as an exempt resource (and it will as long as she uses it for transportation),
Maria's period of ineligibility for SSI will last only one month.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;What if Katherine
did not pay the insurance company directly?</strong> Assume Katherine did not pay for the
insurance, but gave the $1,200 directly to Maria saying: &quot;Aunt Susie wanted you to
use this for insurance, but you will have to decide how to use the money.&quot; Maria uses
$500 to pay for the first six months of insurance premiums, and uses the other $700 to pay
off bills. How would these events affect her SSI?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the facts, Katherine
has given Maria the $1,200 with a suggestion for its use. In reality, there are no strings
attached to the $1,200. Therefore, it will be treated as income in the month it is
received as it is available to meet Maria's needs for food or shelter. Since the income
does not come from earnings, it will be unearned income and will make Maria ineligible for
SSI for at least one month. (The infrequent unearned income rule would apply but would be
of limited value since the total is a lot more than $60.) In later months it will be
treated as a resource and will not affect Maria's SSI eligibility so long as the $1,200
combined with other non-exempt resources is $2,000 or less.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>MARIA STARTS WORKING FOR KATHERINE</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria has continued to
receive the $357 in SSDI benefits and an SSI supplement. In January 2006, she starts
working for Katherine in her small shop where Katherine sells hand-crafted stained glass
lamps and jewelry. Maria works 12 hours per week, making $7 per hour. She is paid every
two weeks, earning $168 gross and taking home $130.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;How will the wages
affect Maria's SSI?</strong> The gross pay that Maria receives each month will count as
earned income. Since Maria is paid every two weeks, in most months she will get two
paychecks. Every six months she will have a third paycheck. Therefore, her gross pay is
$336 in two-paycheck months and $504 in three-paycheck months.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we must do one
calculation to determine countable unearned income and a separate calculation to determine
countable earned income. We can make a user-friendly SSI Budget Worksheet available to our
readers to make this budgeting process easier. Call us at 1-888-224-3272, toll free, to
request a copy of the budget worksheet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SSDI, as unearned
income, will be reduced by $20 to $337 ($357 - 20). For earned income, we will use the
figure of $336 for two paycheck months and $504 for three paycheck months. With the SSI
program excluding the first $65 and 50 percent of the remaining gross monthly income, her
countable earned income in most months will be $135.50 ($336 - 65 = $271 ÷ 2 = $135.50).
Combined with the $337 in countable unearned income, she how has $472.50 in countable
income reducing her monthly SSI check to $193.50 ($666 - 472.50).</p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>MARIA STARTS MAKING NECKLACES AT HOME</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During January 2006, Maria
learned from Katherine how to make some of her better selling necklaces. Katherine agreed
that Maria could make them at home, working on her own schedule. Katherine agrees to pay
Maria $12 for each necklace made. Maria makes 10 necklaces in February 2006 in addition to
working in the shop, making an additional $120 in gross pay. Katherine provides the tools
and supplies for this work and treats this as part of Maria's employment (we will not
treat this as self-employment). In February, in addition to working 12 hours per week at
$7 per hour, Maria makes the extra $120 working at home.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How will the
additional $120 from the work at home affect Maria's SSI? </strong>The additional $120
will be treated as earned income and added to the gross earned income that Maria is
already making. Now, her gross earned income will be $456 in two-paycheck months and $624
in three-paycheck months. Using the same formula used above, for a two-paycheck month,
Maria's countable earned income will now be $195.50 ($456 - 65 = $391 ÷ 2 = $195.50).
Combined with the $337 in countable unearned income from her SSDI check ($357 - 20), she
now has $532.50 in countable income reducing her monthly SSI check to $133.50 ($666 -
532.50). (We are using 2005 SSI rates for all calculations.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>MARIA GETS A LUMBAR-SUPPORT CHAIR</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria continues to make the
necklaces at home, but struggles to make more than 10 of them working at her kitchen
table. In addition to her emotional disability, Maria also has arthritic pain in her lower
back from an old injury. Sitting on a kitchen chair to do this work aggravates the pain
and, as a result, she can only make 10 necklaces per month.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria tells her doctor
about the lower back pain and the doctor prescribes a special chair with lumbar support.
The chair will cost $240. Katherine agrees to buy the chair and allow Maria to pay off the
$240 at $60 per month by deducting the $60 from her paycheck. Maria receives the chair in
late March 2006, with Katherine agreeing to reduce her pay by $60 per month during April,
May, June, and July to recover the $240.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria starts using the
lumbar chair in April and can now work much longer before the back pain starts to bother
her. She now makes 20 necklaces in April 2006 and earns $240 for working at home. She
continues to work 12 hours per week in the store for $7 per hour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Can Maria deduct
the cost of the chair as an impairment related work expense?</strong> Under these facts,
the payment for the chair meets the three-part test for an impairment related work expense
(IRWE): 1) Maria pays for it; 2) it is related to her disability (or, effective with a
March 26, 2004 policy change, is related to some medical impairment for which she is being
treated); and 3) she could not do the extra work without incurring the expense to obtain
the item. Since Maria is paying off a loan for the chair by making payments of $60 per
month, she is entitled to a $60 IRWE deduction each month for four months.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;How will Maria's
SSI check be affected by her increased income and expenses incurred during April?</strong>
Maria now has unearned income of $357 from SSDI and earned income of $576 ($336 for work
in the store, $240<i> </i>for the necklaces). She would have an extra $168 from the store
if it was a three-paycheck month. We do the budget the same way as above, but now subtract
the $60 per month as an IRWE. Maria's countable earned income will now be $225.50 ($576 -
65 - 60 = $451 ÷ 2 - $225.50). Combined with the $337 in countable unearned income from
her SSDI check ($357 - 20), she how has $562.50 in countable income reducing her monthly
SSI check to $103.50 ($666 - 562.50). Because the $60 IRWE is deducted before the
additional 50 percent exclusion, the actual reduction in countable income (and resulting
increase in SSI payment) is one-half that amount or $30.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>VESID PAYS FOR JEWELRY MAKING COURSE, EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES,
AND LUMBAR SUPPORT CHAIR</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's change the facts.
Katherine does not purchase the $240 chair for Maria. However, the Office of Vocational
and Educational Services for Individual with Disabilities (VESID) agrees to provide the
chair and pays for it during June 2006. VESID also agrees to pay for Maria to attend a
six-week, jewelry making course; and to purchase equipment and supplies so that she can
expand her jewelry making at home. Continue to assume that Maria will increase her
productivity by using the special chair. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Can she deduct the
cost of the chair as an IRWE?</strong> Maria will not be able to deduct the cost of the
chair as an IRWE because she has not paid for the item herself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;When VESID pays for
the jewelry-making class, the equipment, and supplies, will any of these payments be
counted as income to Maria?</strong> VESID's payment for these items will not be treated
as income to Maria and will not affect her SSI. This is because this payment does not meet
SSI's definition of in-kind income (i.e., something other than cash that can be used to
meet her needs for food or shelter). This also falls into what SSI calls &quot;non-income
items,&quot; as bills paid to a third party for something other than food or shelter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Will the equipment
and supplies count toward Maria's $2000 resource limit?</strong> Under the current rules,
SSI will no longer consider household goods and personal effects when determining
countable resources. However, if SSI determines the equipment and supplies do not meet the
definition of household goods and personal effects, can these resources be excluded? Yes,
this would be excluded as property essential for self-support. In this case, it is
essential for self support because it will be used by Maria in her trade or business.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>CONCLUSION</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article has provided a
practical application of SSI's income and resource rules, to supplement the more technical
description of those rules presented in our previous newsletter. As always, readers should

<p align="center"><strong><big>THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CORNER</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Question:</i> I receive
$700 per month in SSDI benefits based on my long-term mental illness. I started working
last year and finished my nine-month trial work period last month. Since I have been
making about $880 in gross wages per month, I understand this would ordinarily be
considered substantial gainful activity (SGA) as it is more than $830 per month. My
employer allows me to use a full sick day each month to attend weekly visits with my
mental health counselor. I also use at least one paid vacation day each month to make sure
that I limit my work-related stress. When the Social Security Administration (SSA) looks
at my wages to see if I am performing SGA, will they count the money I make as sick time
or vacation time? I am concerned about whether I will soon lose my SSDI benefits.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Answer:</i> You are
correct that SSA considers $830 per month to be SGA in 2005 (the amount would be $1,380 if
you are legally blind). This means that if SSA counted your full $880 per month against
the SGA rule, you would soon begin to lose your monthly SSDI checks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our Summer 2004
newsletter, we explained in detail how these rules work. We explained that during the
nine-month trial work period, you continue to get SSDI checks no matter how much you make.
If you are earning at the SGA level the month after the trial work period ends, you will
get benefits for three more months (a grace period). You will then be in your extended
period of eligibility (EPE) for the next 33 consecutive months. During the EPE, you will
get an SSDI check for any month when your gross countable wages are below the SGA amount;
you will not get a check for any month when your gross countable wages are more than the
SGA amount.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have got good news for
you! SSA has a special policy covering vacation and sick pay. This appears in SSA's policy
manual at POMS DI 10505.010 C. It provides:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When evaluating earnings for substantial gainful activity purposes, consider only
    earnings derived from actual work activity for the month under consideration. If the
    individual receives sick or vacation pay for non-work days in a particular month, that pay
    should not be considered countable income for that month.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on what you have told
us, you earn about $40 per day in gross wages. This would mean that if you used one sick
day and one vacation day in a month, your gross countable wages, for SGA purposes, would
be reduced to $800 per month ($880 - 80). At $800 per month, you would not be performing
SGA. If this is your situation every month, it appears that you will not face a loss of
your SSDI benefit during the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We suggest that you contact
the Benefits Planning, Assistance and Outreach (BPAO) project in your region for
assistance. If you call our toll-free work incentives hotline at 1-888-224-3272, we'd be
happy to provide you with the phone number for the BPAO project in your area.</p>
