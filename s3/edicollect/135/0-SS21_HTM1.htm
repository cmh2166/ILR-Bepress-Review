<p align="center"><strong><big><big><big><big><u>Public and Subsidized Housing:<br>
</u></big></big></big>Housing Subsidies and Work Incentives for Tenants with Disabilities<br>
</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all Americans, persons with
disabilities must have a place to live. For those who also have limited income, the cost
of rental housing can be a major barrier to finding a suitable apartment that they can
afford. This barrier is expanded for individuals who also need accessible housing based on
the nature of their disability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public and subsidized housing programs have,
during the past 50 years, grown to become a major source of affordable housing for
individuals and families with limited income. These programs have also become a source of
accessible housing for some individuals with disabilities. In many communities, the only
rental units that can meet the needs of persons who are wheelchair users are those found
in federally subsidized housing programs. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This article will discuss the public and
subsidized housing programs available to persons with disabilities, with a focus on those
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). We will briefly
summarize some of the key programs available, who runs them, who is eligible, and how the
tenant&#146;s share of rent is determined. We will then focus on some special rules that
apply for the counting of income and resources of tenants or tenant family members with
disabilities, with a specific emphasis on those &#147;incentives&#148; that encourage work
activity and work goals for persons with disabilities. In particular, we will explain in
detail the earned income disregard rules that were implemented in recent years for tenants
in public housing and tenants with disabilities in four separate housing subsidy programs.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this short article, we cannot possibly
cover every issue involving public and subsidized housing programs. Nor will we be able to
cover any number of other programs that provide housing opportunities for persons with
disabilities, including state and locally-sponsored programs, community residences (i.e.,
group homes), adult homes, and individual residential alternatives, just to name a few. As
always, readers who have unanswered questions can call our state work incentives hotline,
toll-free, at 1-888-224-3272. If the question goes beyond our expertise (and some housing
issues will), we should be able to provide you with a referral source to follow up. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><big>What is Public and Subsidized Housing? </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federally subsidized housing programs began
under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. Over the years, the number of programs has greatly
expanded. These HUD-sponsored programs take two forms: public housing and privately-owned
housing that is federally subsidized. While both are forms of subsidized housing, when the
term &#147;subsidized housing&#148; is used it is often referring to private subsidized
housing as distinguished from public housing. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>Public Housing </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historically, government-owned and managed
public housing was the primary form of subsidized housing available to low-income
families. Public housing is owned and managed by a local public housing authority (PHA).
These units take many forms from high-rise apartment buildings to detached single-family
dwellings, and may be located at one site or scattered over several sites. Federal law
requires that public housing be accessible to individuals with disabilities making it an
attractive option for low-income families that include a member with a severe physical or
sensory disability. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public housing may also be an attractive
option for families who have a poor rent payment history due to financial circumstances.
While such a history might otherwise preclude admission to public housing, a family
member&#146;s willingness to increase family income by entering the workforce, or by
enrolling in a training or employment program, may be considered by the housing authority
to overcome this poor payment history. (Note: A tenant &#147;family&#148; generally
includes families consisting of one individual.) </p>

<p align="center"><strong>Subsidized Housing in the Private Market </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the late 1960s, the focus has been to
involve the private sector in low-income housing programs by providing subsidies for
rentals in privately-developed, and/or privately-owned housing developments. In the last
40 years, a variety of federal housing programs have evolved to further this strategy of
providing housing assistance to low-income families through the private housing market. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Project-based subsidy programs. These
include, for example, the Section 8 program (&#147;project-based Section 8&quot;), section
202 supportive housing for the elderly, section 236 housing, and the Section 811
Supportive Housing Program. These programs are all HUD-sponsored, multi-family
developments. The Section 811 program assists very low-income households that include
persons with disabilities. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher
Program. One of most popular programs to emerge is the Section 8 Housing Voucher program,
sometimes called &#147;tenant-based&#148; Section 8 because the tenant holds a voucher
that can be used in the private housing market. The tenant-based rent subsided programs
have been merged into one program called the Housing Choice Voucher Program. Because it
replaces the longstanding Section 8 program, some call it the Section 8 Housing Choice
Voucher Program; some still call it Section 8. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Housing Choice Voucher Program,
tenants can rent housing in the private market. Because assistance is tenant-based, the
subsidy is considered portable and an eligible individual or family may use their voucher
to lease a unit anywhere in the U.S. where a Housing Choice Voucher Program exists. The
tenant pays a portion of the rent based on household income, and a public housing agency
pays a portion of the rent directly to the private landlord. We mentioned earlier that
public housing authorities are referred to as PHAs - - well, confusingly enough, Section 8
&#147;public housing agencies&#148; are also referred to as PHAs. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PHA sets a &#147;payment standard&#148;
based upon the HUD-calculated fair market rent for the area. Assisted families may rent
units that cost more or less than the payment standard. If an assisted family rents a unit
that costs more than the payment standard, the tenant will be responsible for paying their
portion of the rent and the portion of the rent that exceeds the amount of the payment
standard for the area. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is an example of a tenant
family that must pay the portion of the rent that exceeds the payment standard for the
area: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Candice and her one child receive a Housing Choice Voucher subsidy and live in a
  two-bedroom apartment that costs $550. The payment standard for her community is $500 per
  month, for this size apartment, and the family&#146;s countable income is $600. Candice
  will owe $230 as rent, based on 30 percent of her countable family income (.30 x $600 =
  $180) plus the amount by which her rent exceeds the local payment standard ($50). </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><big><strong>Eligibility Criteria for Public and Subsidized Housing </strong></big></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While most of the core eligibility criteria
will be uniform throughout the family of HUD-sponsored programs, there may be some
differences from program to program. Readers should always check with the individual
program for the most up-to-date rules governing the program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; Income eligibility.</strong> This differs
from program to program. An applicant&#146;s adjusted annual income must not exceed the
income limit for the applicable HUD program. Income limitations are based upon the median
income in the area where the program is located. For example, public housing applicants
must be low-income families, defined by HUD as families with an income that is no greater
than 80 percent of the area&#146;s median income. Housing Choice Voucher program
applicants must be very low-income families, with income not exceeding 50 percent of the
area&#146;s median income. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your local PHA can provide information about
median income and income limits for your area. This information is also available from the
HUD User website at www.huduser.org (select the &#147;data sets&#148; link). Applicants
for federally-assisted and state-regulated developments must meet the federal program
requirements. Household composition is a factor in determining income eligibility and in
determining whether the household is eligible for a specific unit based upon occupancy
standards and the number of bedrooms. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; Tenant assets.</strong> There is no asset
limit in HUD-assisted housing programs. However, annual income does include net income
from family assets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Citizenship status</strong>.
Applicants for federally assisted housing must be citizens or non-citizens with eligible
immigration status. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; Disability-related preferences.</strong>
Public housing authorities and agencies have a great deal of discretion in adopting local
preferences. These preferences allow qualified candidates to move up on the waiting lists
that often exist in a federally subsidized housing program. Some housing providers have
chosen to give individuals with disabilities broader access to affordable housing through
a disability-related preference. Others grant preferences to tenants who are currently
working, or who are making the transition into the workforce. Advocates should be aware of
local preferences that may assist tenants who are moving into the job market. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disability-related preferences may also
affect the assignment of accessible units in public housing and in project-based
developments. Housing providers must first offer accessible units to current tenants who
require the unit&#146;s special features. If no tenants meet this criteria, the provider
must then offer the unit to the next qualified applicant on the waiting list with a family
member who needs the special feature. Although a person does not need to meet the
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)
definitions of disability to qualify for these preferences, a person who receives either
SSI or SSDI will automatically meet the disability criteria in HUD-sponsored programs.
Persons whose disability is based solely on drug or alcohol dependence are not considered
disabled for HUD-sponsored programs. </p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>Calculation of Tenant&#146;s Rent Obligation </strong></big></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of the core criteria for calculating
rent obligations and determining what income is counted will be uniform throughout the
family of HUD-sponsored programs. However, there will be some differences from program to
program. Readers should always check with the individual program for the most up-to-date
rules governing the program, keeping in mind that these rules are so detailed that housing
providers may not always be aware of all the special provisions that apply to persons with
disabilities. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, families who receive federal
housing assistance pay the <u>higher</u> of the following amounts as rent: 

<ul>
  <li>30 percent of the family&#146;s monthly adjusted income, or</li>
  <li>10 percent of the family&#146;s monthly income, or</li>
  <li>If the family receives welfare assistance, the assistance that is specifically
    designated for housing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total tenant payment.</strong> The
amount that the tenant family must pay, based upon the above criteria, is called the total
tenant payment. For federally subsidized, project-based programs including public housing,
the tenant rent is generally synonymous with total tenant payment. The calculation may be
slightly different in the Housing Choice Voucher Program if the tenant rents a unit that
rents for more than the payment standard as discussed above.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>What counts as income?</strong>
Because rent is based upon income, the way in which income is calculated and defined
greatly impacts upon a family&#146;s monthly rental payment. Under federal regulations
governing housing authorities and agencies, annual income is broadly defined as all
amounts, monetary or not, which go to any family member (including temporarily absent
family heads or spouses), unless an amount is excluded by law. Annual income also includes
amounts derived during the year from assets belonging to any family member.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Income exclusions</strong>. Some of
the mandatory income exclusions include: 

<ul>
  <li>Wages of children, including foster children, who are under age 18</li>
  <li>Lump-sum additions to family assets: e.g., insurance payments under health and accident
    insurance, worker&#146;s compensation, and personal injury settlements</li>
  <li>Amounts received for or in reimbursement of the cost of medical expenses</li>
  <li>Income of a live-in aide</li>
  <li>Student financial assistance paid directly to the student or educational institution</li>
  <li>Amounts received under training programs funded by HUD</li>
  <li>Amounts disregarded for a limited time under SSI&#146;s Plan for Achieving Self-Support
    (PASS)</li>
  <li>Incremental earnings and benefits received by any family member in qualifying state or
    local employment training programs</li>
  <li>Amounts received by participants in publicly-assisted training programs for job-related
    expenses (e.g., special equipment, clothing, transportation, child care)</li>
  <li>Lump sum, retroactive SSI or Social Security benefits</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the following example, regarding a
person who receives a lump sum of SSI benefits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Joan is single and was recently awarded retroactive SSI benefits totaling $20,000.
  Her monthly benefit will be $587 and her first retroactive check is for $7,044 (monthly
  benefit rate of $587 x 12 months). Six months after receiving her first retroactive check,
  Joan receives a second check for $7,044. She will receive a third check for $5,912 six
  months after receiving the second check (making $20,000 paid in full). Joan&#146;s monthly
  $587 payment is counted as income. The retroactive payments are not. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two other mandatory income
exclusions</strong> can be important to individuals with disabilities. One covers the
un-reimbursed medical expenses of elderly or &#147;disabled families&#148; (i.e., families
whose head, spouse or sole member is a person with disabilities, or a family with two or
more people with disabilities living together, or one or more persons with disabilities
living with an aide). The other provision excludes un-reimbursed attendant care and
auxiliary apparatus expenses for a family member with a disability to the extent necessary
to enable any family member to be employed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are limitations that come into play
with deductions for these special expenses. The first is that these deductions are equal
only to the amount that the costs exceed three percent of the family&#146;s annual income.
Another is that the deduction for attendant care and auxiliary apparatus expenses may not
exceed the earned income received by family members 18 years of age and older, who are
able to work because of such care or auxiliary apparatus. Auxiliary apparatus include
wheelchairs, ramps, adaptations to vehicles, or special equipment to allow a blind person
to read or type, but only if these items are directly related to enabling the individual
with a disability or other family member to work. Allowable medical expenses include such
items as transportation to treatment, eyeglasses, hearing aides, and monthly payments on
accumulated medical bills.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following example illustrates use of
this income exclusion for an individual who is working:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Gary uses a specially equipped van to get to work. The annual payments on the van
  (in excess of payments on a car without special equipment) total $3,000. Gary and his
  family also have $1,200 in medical expenses. The family&#146;s annual income is $20,000.
  Gary earns $12,000 at his job. Three percent of the family&#146;s annual income is $600.
  The family&#146;s combined disability and medical expenses exceed three percent of income
  and may be deducted. Gary&#146;s family is entitled to a $3,600 deduction for their
  combined medical expenses that represents the amount by which the sum of both the
  disability and medical expenses ($3,000 + $1,200 = $4,200) exceeds three percent of annual
  income ($4,200 (expenses) - $600 (three percent of income) = $3,600 annual deduction).<br>
  NOTE: If we assume the total tenant payment for Gary&#146;s family is based on 30 percent
  of their countable income, these deductions will reduce their monthly rental obligation by
  about $90 ($300 monthly deduction x .30). </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional earned income exclusions.</strong>
Only public housing programs (not project-based or Housing Choice Voucher programs) may
exercise broad discretion in adopting additional exclusions for earned income. These
income exclusions may include amounts necessary to replace benefits lost due to employment
(e.g., medical insurance or other medical costs), amounts paid to individuals outside the
family (e.g., child support or alimony), or costs incurred in order to go to work (e.g.,
the cost of special tools, equipment, or clothing).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the mandatory income
exclusions already mentioned, the annual income of federally subsidized tenant families is
further adjusted by the following mandatory income deductions: $480 for each dependent,
$400 for elderly families, and $400 for disabled families. Public housing authorities may
authorize additional deductions from annual income. Other HUD programs must calculate
additional deductions only as permitted by applicable program regulations. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>Special Earned Income Disregards </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During recent years, some important work
incentives have been introduced into public housing programs and four other subsidized
housing programs. In public housing, these earned income exclusions apply to all tenant
families. In the other four programs, they apply only to tenants with disabilities. The
four additional programs include the Housing Choice Voucher Program, the HOME Investment
Partnerships Program, the HOPWA (or Housing Opportunities for Persons with Aids) Program,
and the Supportive Housing Program. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>When a tenant family is entitled to
the disregard. </strong>Within the tenant family, the person with increased income must
meet the criteria for being unemployed or underemployed (see below). The disregard is also
available for increased employment income if the family received welfare benefits
(including such benefits as one-time payments and transportation assistance) during the
prior six months or if the family income increased during a family member&#146;s
participation in a self-sufficiency or job training program. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>How these special rules affect the
counting of earned income</strong>. If the tenant meets the criteria specified, housing
subsidy providers, in the programs described above, must disregard 100 percent of any
increased employment income for a period of 12 months from the date that a member of an
eligible family is first employed or from the date that the family&#146;s income
increases. In addition, for the second period of 12 months following employment or
increased income, the PHA or housing provider is required to exclude 50 percent of any
increase in employment-related income. The disallowance of increased income is limited to
any 24 months (and they need not be consecutive months) within a 48-month period. An
individual is entitled to this disregard only once in a lifetime. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This example illustrates how the earned
income disregard can be applied: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Maria and her two children receive assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher
  Program. Maria is disabled and gets SSI benefits; her children receive welfare benefits.
  Maria, who has not worked during the previous 12 months, enters a job-training program and
  the monthly household income increases by a total of $562. The $562 increase in overall
  income will be disregarded and the household&#146;s share of the total rent remains the
  same. Maria remains in the program for 3 months. When the training program ends, the
  household&#146;s monthly income returns to the original level. Maria has used 3 months of
  her 12-month, 100 percent disregard. The earned income disregard at 100 percent applies
  for a full 12-month period during which a tenant is receiving wages. <br>
  If employment is interrupted as in this example, the disregard is tolled or put on hold
  until the tenant is employed again. Tenants (i.e., all qualified household members,
  whether they are technically tenants or occupants) have 48 months total in which to use
  the earned income disregard. In Maria&#146;s case, let&#146;s say after completing the
  job-training program, she looks for work for 2 months, then finds a job and her total
  monthly household income increases by $974. This $974 increase in income will be
  disregarded for 9 months (making 12 months in total). At the end of 9 months, 50 percent
  of the increase, or $487 will be disregarded for 12 more months, and the household&#146;s
  rent will be recalculated based upon this increased household income. (Keep in mind that
  the increase in income from wages will be offset, in part, by a reduction in her SSI
  benefits.)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specific criteria is used to determine
whether a family is eligible for an earned income disregard, based on 12 months of
unemployment or underemployment. A tenant family is eligible for the disregard if the
family income increases as a result of employment of a family member who was previously
unemployed (defined as earning no more than would be received for working 10 hours per
week for 50 weeks at the established minimum wage in the 12 months previous to employment)
for one or more years. </p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reporting changes in income.</strong>
Most subsidized housing programs update income information about once per year. But what
about income changes that occur in between reporting periods? What impact do interim
reporting requirements have on the earned income disregard?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interim income reporting requirements can
have a big impact on how newly generated earned income affects a tenant&#146;s rental
obligation. The various housing subsidy programs have different requirements about when a
tenant has to report changes in income. For those consumers who are entitled to the earned
income disregard, interim reporting requirements play less of a role. Consider the
following example involving Roberta: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><em>Roberta receives SSI payments totaling $587 per month. Pursuant to her
  Housing Choice Voucher Program lease agreement, Roberta is not obligated to report
  increased income until her annual re-certification in December. In July 2004 Roberta
  begins to work earning $1,085 per month and her SSI check is reduced to $87 per month.
  Without the earned income disregard, Roberta&#146;s rent would have increased in January
  2005. However, because Roberta benefitted in January from not having to report her
  increased income for six months, she is entitled only to six more months of the 100
  percent disregard. <br>
  Beginning in July 2005 and for 12 months thereafter, Roberta&#146;s rent will be
  calculated based upon a 50 percent disregard. When increases in earned income are not
  reported by a tenant the disallowance takes effect retroactively to the date the new rent
  should have taken effect. The tenant should not be penalized for the failure to timely
  report the increase in employment income as long as the tenant was eligible for the earned
  income disregard. This is due to the fact that the household would experience no increase
  in rent, at least for the first 12 months, as a result of the increase in earned income
  because of the earned income disregard. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><strong>Individual Savings Accounts </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an alternative to earned income
disregards, public housing authorities may, at their option, also offer Individual Savings
Accounts for those tenant families who pay an income-based rent. At the option of the
tenant family, the public housing authority will deposit the total amount that would have
been calculated as increased tenant rent, resulting from the increased employment income,
into an interest-bearing savings account. The tenant family may only withdraw the monies
deposited in the account for:

<ul>
  <li>Purchasing a home</li>
  <li>Paying the education costs of a family member </li>
  <li>Moving from public housing </li>
  <li>Paying other expenses approved by the housing authority that promote economic
    self-sufficiency</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the family moves from public housing, the
housing authority must pay the family any balance in the account, minus any amounts owed
to the housing authority. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>The Family Self-Sufficiency Program</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program is
a special work incentive designed to promote employment and to increase savings for
families receiving Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program assistance or living in public
housing. PHAs that received HUD funds for additional units between 1993 and 1998 are
required to maintain FSS programs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FSS program participants enter into a
service plan and a contract that measure the family&#146;s progress in achieving
self-sufficiency. Self-sufficiency is defined as independence from housing subsidies and
welfare cash assistance. The head of the family is required to agree to seek and maintain
suitable employment through the term of the FSS contract. Successful completion of the FSS
program occurs when all the family&#146;s agreed upon self-sufficiency objectives are met
or when 30 percent of the family&#146;s adjusted monthly income equals or exceeds the fair
market rent for the family&#146;s unit. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two main components of an FSS program
are case management and the FSS escrow account. Each family in the FSS program is provided
with a case manager. Participating families are provided with opportunities for education,
job training, and counseling, together with services such as childcare and transportation
assistance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under a fairly complicated set of rules, the
money that goes into the FSS escrow account is largely dependant on the extra earned
income generated by the tenant family member who starts work or increases the amount of
work they are performing. For more details on this program, see Supporting the Employment
Outcomes of SSI and SSDI Beneficiaries in Section 8 or Subsidized Housing, available on

<p align="center"><strong><big>Advocacy Programs for Housing Subsidy Issues </big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerous advocacy programs exist, throughout
the state, that may be able to assist tenants with disabilities when issues arise in a
public or subsidized housing program. Keep in mind that agency priorities are set locally,
meaning that some of these programs may offer more or less help than others:</p>

<p>Legal Services/Legal Aid: Offer free legal service to individuals with limited income.
One will exist for each county or region of the state. For example, Neighborhood Legal
Services, with its partner agencies, Niagara County Legal Aid and Oak Orchard Legal
Services, covers a five-county area in Western N.Y.</p>

<p>Protection and Advocacy Programs: The state Commission on Quality of Care provides
grants to legal services agencies, law schools, and other advocacy agencies to offer free
legal services to individuals with disabilities. For example, one of these programs,
Protection and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security, can assist SSI and SSDI
beneficiaries if the non-enforcement of a housing rule presents a barrier to successful
work.</p>

<p>Benefits Planning, Assistance and Outreach (BPA&amp;O) Projects: The primary focus of
these agencies is to assist SSI and SSDI beneficiaries, and the individuals who work with
them, to understand and use the various work incentives that exist in SSI, SSDI, and other
government programs, including housing subsidy programs. BPA&amp;O staff will often assist
beneficiaries, informally, to enforce their rights under the new earned income disregard
rules that exist in some housing programs. However, if a hearing or litigation is needed
to enforce the rule, the case would need to be referred to one of the programs mentioned
above.</p>

<p>For information on the advocacy programs that exist in your area, call the State Work
Incentives Support Center at 1-888-224-3272.</p>
