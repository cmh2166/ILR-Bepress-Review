<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>Working-age Americans with disabilities are much more
likely to live in poverty than other Americans and generally did not share in
the economic prosperity of the late 1990s. At the same time, public
expenditures to support them are growing at a rate that will be difficult to
sustain when the baby boom generation retires and begins to draw Social
Security Retirement and Medicare benefits. We argue that this discouraging
situation will continue unless we can bring disability programs into line with
more contemporary understanding of the capabilities of people with disabilities
and successfully implement broad, systemic reforms to promote their economic
self-sufficiency. This policy brief summarizes a larger paper (Stapleton,
O’Day, Livermore &amp; Imparato, 2005).  It suggests principles to guide
reforms and encourage debate.  Future policy briefs will elaborate on some of
these principles. </p>

<h1>Dependence on Public Programs is Growing and People Still Live in Poverty</h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>The employment rate of working-age people with
disabilities is about half of the employment rate of working-age people without
disabilities, regardless of what national survey is used or how disability is
measured.  According to the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 38 percent of working-age people with at least one
disability were employed in 2003, compared with 78 percent of people reporting
none of the disabilities measured by the survey (Weathers 2005). Poverty rates
for people with at least one disability are more than twice as high as for
those with no disabilities (See Figure 1). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>The fact that people with disabilities are falling
further behind others economically is not due to a decline in public
expenditures for their support. In fact, almost nine million working-age adults
with disabilities receive income support from the Social Security Disability
Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs; about $87.3
billion is currently being spent on these programs annually.  Rather, the poverty
rate and quality of life of beneficiaries has not significantly improved
despite ever increasing expenditures (Burkhauser, Houtenville &amp; Rovba,
2004; Burkhauser, Daly &amp; Houtenville, 2001; Burkhauser &amp; Stapleton,
2003; Burkhauser &amp; Stapleton 2004).  This is partly because benefits are
often insufficient to lift incomes above the poverty standard (the maximum
federal SSI benefit is now only about 75 percent of the federal poverty
standard for an individual), partly because many people with disabilities do
not receive support from these programs, and partly because people who are on
benefits are often unable to add to these benefits by working. </p>

<h1>Today’s Support Policies Create a Poverty Trap</h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>Today’s income support policies are built on the obsolete
premise that people with particular disabilities cannot work, and therefore
must rely on others for support. These policies create a poverty trap for many
people with disabilities. An initial critical component of the poverty trap is
that when people apply for Social Security disability benefits (either SSI or
SSDI), they must demonstrate that they cannot work by not working. A second
component involves the rules that sharply reduce benefits as a beneficiary’s
earnings increase. SSDI beneficiaries are able to earn up to the Social
Security Administration’s (SSA’s) substantial gainful activity (SGA) level each
month ($830 for SSDI non-blind beneficiaries, and $1,380 for blind
beneficiaries in 2005) without losing any benefits, but if earnings exceed that
amount by as little as one dollar for nine months or more, the beneficiary
faces the “earnings cliff” where all SSDI cash benefits are lost. For those
with benefits in excess of SGA, the income loss can actually be greater than
the individual’s earnings. Beneficiaries who return to work within the first 24
months also lose the opportunity to qualify for Medicare coverage, which is
provided 24 months after the individual is found eligible for SSDI.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>The SSI recipient faces a different constraint; after
earnings reach $65 per month, benefits are reduced by one dollar for every two
dollars of additional earnings. Put differently, the SSI recipient’s income is
implicitly taxed at a rate of 50 percent – a tax rate that is higher than that
paid by even the wealthiest individuals. Many may also face reductions in food
stamps, housing subsidies, and other assistance as their earnings increase. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>Another significant component of the poverty trap is the
sheer complexity and poor coordination of support systems for people with disabilities.
The many in-kind supports that are available to people with disabilities are
administered by a variety of state and federal agencies and private
organizations, each with its own rules, many of which are very complex in their
own right and take a great deal of time to understand. Each additional program
improvement seems to add to, not remove, this complexity.  <span
style='color:black'>As Oi (1978; 1992) says, “Disability steals time.” The
gross inefficiency of our current support system steals even more.</span> </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>The final key element of the poverty trap is the
self-fulfilling expectation, ingrained in the support system, that people with
disabilities cannot support themselves, or perhaps worse, may come to believe
that they cannot contribute to their own support through working. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>In this policy environment, many individuals with
significant functional limitations and relatively low earnings capacity face
the following choice. They can work, receive wages, perhaps obtain some in-kind
supports, and live in or near poverty. Or, they can severely limit their work,
navigate the support system, and receive income and in-kind benefits that also
leave them in or near poverty. They are trapped. The problem is not that the
benefit levels and supports are too generous; it is that low-wage beneficiaries
need a gradual reduction in benefits and the provision of some in-kind supports
to make employment pay off.  A successful economic self-sufficiency policy
would create greater incentives and opportunities to escape poverty.</p>

<h1>The Transition to Economic Self-sufficiency Policy is Already Under Way But
Has Been Largely Ineffective</h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>It has been more than thirty years since the beginning of
the independent living movement, and the idea of people with disabilities
living, working, and participating in their communities has become the
expectation and goal of many current programs and policies.  In 1999, the
Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act (“Ticket Act”) provided for
additional choice in rehabilitation providers and additional incentives for
people to work and leave the benefit rolls.  More recently, President Bush has
developed the New Freedom Initiative, a nationwide effort to remove barriers to
community living for people with disabilities and long-term illnesses.  There
have also been recent bipartisan efforts to encourage low-income populations,
including low-income people with disabilities, to improve their financial
literacy and to acquire assets. These kinds of savings programs, when coupled
with an earned income stream, can help to address the long-term poverty that
many Americans with disabilities currently experience.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>Despite the intent of these current policy reforms and
initiatives, it seems unlikely that they will achieve substantial progress
toward greater economic self-sufficiency of people with disabilities and a
higher standard of living for three reasons: first, these policy reforms do not
adequately address work disincentives; second, they increase the already
excessive complexity of the current support system rather than reduce it; and
third, they fail to address the unrealistically low expectations of the work
capacity of individuals with disabilities when appropriate supports are
provided.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>Thus far, policymakers have taken a piecemeal approach
toward policy changes that will promote economic self-sufficiency and increase
the standard of living for people with disabilities. We try to at least
partially correct specific problems with specific programs, without addressing
the many other problems that need to be corrected. We are adding complexity to
the programs, making them even harder to administer, and failing to address
their long-term fiscal health.</p>

<h1>To Be More Successful, Policy Reforms Must Include Several Key Features</h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>To make significant progress, it will be necessary to
develop and implement system-wide reforms that fundamentally change support
policies by replacing today’s obsolete policies that promote program dependence
with policies that promote economic self-sufficiency. We suggest an overarching
goal, and related principles to guide reforms.  We also strongly emphasize a
holistic approach to policy reform, which we believe is necessary to make real
and lasting change that empowers millions of people with disabilities to escape
poverty.  </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>Our system-wide goal is maximum economic
self-sufficiency at a reasonable standard of living for every person facing a
significant challenge to employment because of functional limitations.</i></b> 
We list below some of the principles to guide such policy reform, but
acknowledge the complexity of such sweeping systemic reforms and the trade-offs
inherent in some of the policy choices these principles present.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>Sustainable:</i> </b>The system must be designed to
obtain the long-term public support of the voters and key interest groups. In
all likelihood, growth in public expenditures will need to be reduced. As
importantly, the system would have features that voters generally support, such
as personal responsibility for one’s own actions and well-being, efficient use
of public resources, and equitable distribution of benefits. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>System-wide eligibility criteria designed to
identify people with significant functional limitations: </i></b>This is
defined in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and
Health (ICF) as a significant deviation or loss in body physiology or
structure, such as loss of sensation in extremities, visual or hearing loss,
paralysis, or anxiety (World Health Organization, 2001).  Although some medical
criteria will be needed to define who is eligible for any supports from the
system, eligibility criteria should move toward a functional definition of
disability; they should not include a work test or be designed to determine
inability to work. Program eligibility should be broadly defined, enabling
eligible individuals to easily obtain the supports they need at any period in
time. Decisions about which supports an individual receives would be separated
from the eligibility decision. Waiting periods for support would be eliminated.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>A rebuttable presumption of ability to work:</i> </b>The
presumption would be that, with appropriate supports, all eligible individuals
can work and at least partially support themselves, despite the challenges
posed by a given individual’s functional limitation. This principle recognizes
that significant numbers of beneficiaries will work only part-time or
intermittently.  This presumption could be automatically rebutted for those
with the most severe impairments, but others would be expected to make good
faith efforts to work over an extended period, after which some might be
classified as completely unable to work. We strongly emphasize that this
principle should not be adopted in isolation of the other principles listed. So
doing would cause great harm to many people with disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>Early intervention: </i></b>Early and timely
efforts would be made to provide supports that will likely lead to successful
entry into the workforce for first-time workers, and continuation of employment
for workers adjusting to disability onset or exacerbation. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>Beneficiary and program responsibility to achieve
program goals:</i> </b>Beneficiaries of system supports would be expected to
take reasonable actions that contribute to their own support and would be held
responsible for doing so. For those who have not rebutted the ability to work
presumption, this would include work effort requirements. Program
administrators and staff would be held to a similar standard. The effort to
help beneficiaries achieve economic self-sufficiency and a reasonable standard
of living, and the success of their effort, would be important criteria in
assessing their performance. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>Incentives that make work pay:</i></b> Those able
only to attain low-wage jobs or to work part-time or intermittently would
receive wage subsidies or tax credits that would both provide them with an
incentive to work, save money, acquire assets, and improve their standard of
living. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>Supports for those who cannot attain a reasonable
standard of living without them:</i> </b>Those who rebut the presumption of
ability to work or who can only work part-time or intermittently would be
eligible for income and in-kind benefits that are sufficient to provide them
with a reasonable standard of living, considering any disability-related
expenses they incur. Those for whom earnings and incentive payments are insufficient
to attain a reasonable standard of living would receive levels of support
intended to bring their income up to the standard established as reasonable. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>Access to health care and assistive technology that
is not linked to employment:</i> </b>To remove availability of health care as a
work disincentive, eligible individuals, particularly those with chronic
conditions, who require personal assistance, or who need ongoing mental health
services, should have access to assistive technology or other long-term services,
without regard to their employment status. Individuals with impairments who are
currently working would be eligible for health insurance, assistive technology,
and other supports to enable them to avoid job loss, without regard to their
eligibility for cash benefits. Although income levels would be considered in
determining the amount of individual subsidies, no one would be made worse off
by working.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>Other supports that are well-coordinated, encourage
work, are easy to navigate, are tailored to the individual’s needs, and are
efficiently delivered</i></b>: Individuals would access support services
through a single point of entry in the system rather than separately from
multiple agencies and administrators. Supports would not be contingent on work
except to the extent that they are needed to support work. Providers would be
paid through a system that encourages them to efficiently meet the needs of the
individual. Individuals with incomes in excess of that needed to support a
reasonable standard of living would be expected to pay for some share of the
services. Employers would be expected to contribute to the extent that such
services might substitute for benefits they would provide to other workers
(e.g., for health insurance) or for expenses that would fall under the ADA’s
“reasonable accommodation” requirement for covered employers. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>Incentives for people with disabilities to improve
their financial literacy, save money, acquire assets, and make investments</i></b>:
Beneficiaries would receive incentives to save money and use assets and
investments as a tool to escape poverty. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>Substantial beneficiary control over the delivery
of supports:</i> </b>Beneficiaries and their agents/representatives would have
a high degree of control over the delivery of supports. For instance, when
feasible they would be allowed to choose providers, and some options would
allow them to obtain services without interrupting work activities.  Support
staff would be available to assist individuals, particularly those with
cognitive disabilities, in managing services and making choices.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>Support services delivered in integrated settings: 
</i></b>To the extent practical, people with disabilities would receive support
services (e.g., health care, education, training, job search, and
transportation) from the same providers that deliver these services to others. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>Recognition of the ongoing effects of disability
discrimination in the workplace:</i> </b>Qualified workers who fail to find
work or lose a job because of discrimination should not be unfairly penalized
by benefit loss.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><b><i>Conduct an extensive public awareness campaign</i>: 
</b>An extensive public awareness campaign about the work capabilities of
people with disabilities, similar in scope to recent anti-drug campaigns, will
be necessary if policy reform is to be effective.  Among others, leaders in
business and government must recognize that tapping into this available and
largely under-utilized labor source is an important opportunity, as well as one
of the most significant challenges facing the U.S. economy. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>The transition to economic self-sufficiency policy has
already begun.  The questions are how it will occur, how fast it will occur,
and how much progress will be achieved.  Our goal is greater economic
self-sufficiency and a higher standard of living for people with disabilities.
That is the issue that challenges us today, and that requires a full and open
debate.</p>
