<p class="MsoNormal"><b>INTRODUCTION/ BACKGROUND</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As any school district administrator will volunteer, special
education is expensive.&nbsp; At a time of high academic accountability from local
taxpayers and from the state and federal government, school districts are
forced to examine the costs and effectiveness of their various educational
programs.&nbsp; Chambers, et al (2004) documented the cost associated with special
education students with the highest needs:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">"…the base expenditure on a
regular education student who requires no services from any special program is
$6,556. A comparison of this figure to the average per pupil expenditures of
students with disabilities at the top of the expenditure distribution reveals
that regardless of the type of school in which students with disabilities are
enrolled, the difference amounts to tens of thousands of dollars, ranging from
a difference of $29,638 for secondary school students who are at the top 5
percent of the expenditure distribution (=35,924-$6,556) to a difference of
$82,410 for students in special education schools who are at the top 1&nbsp; percent
of the expenditure distribution (=$88,966-$6,556)." (p. 6)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Lacking positive student results at graduation, one may well
wonder if this money has been well spent, or could be better allocated in a
different way.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, if the lives of adults with disabilities are
any measure of the impact of decades of special education, there are serious
problems that must addressed.&nbsp; The employment rate among adults with
disabilities, for instance, remains low.&nbsp; Houtenville (2004) indicated: "
In the year 2002, an estimated 30.9 percent (plus or minus 1.0 percentage
points) of civilian, non-institutionalized, men and women with a disability,
aged 18-64 in the United States were employed."&nbsp; This figure alone should
sound an alarm when one considers the future quality of life for our graduating
students.&nbsp; Halpern (1993) recommended we framed such considerations from both a
societal perspective as well as the from the point of view of the person:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">“If someone in transition chooses
any particular outcome, such as employment, then the measurement of that
outcome is relevant for that person.&nbsp; Such measurement can be both objective
(e.g., Is the person employed?) and subjective (e.g., Is the person satisfied
with the job?).” (p. 489)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If a group of students choose paid employment as a goal for
adult life, would not those same students want their educational program to
measure the extent to which students actually earn a paycheck? To summarize,
one must carefully define both the outcome of employment as well as the
practice of career development activities to establish a pattern of effective
practices meaningful to students, their families, educators, employers, agency
personnel and policymakers.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The state Vocational Rehabilitation (<acronym title="V.R.">VR</acronym>) systems and related
agencies may appear to provide a solution to this problem of unemployment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, as Benz, et al (1995) found through their survey of parents and
students with disabilities: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">"Students and parents are: (a)
confused about the transition process and the different transition resources in
the community; (b) intimidated by the <acronym title="V.R.">VR</acronym> application process; (c) frustrated
with the number of assessments that must be conducted for eligibility
determination, and the lack of meaningful information about the reasons for
these assessments; and (d) overwhelmed by, and even somewhat embarrassed about,
the variety of professionals with whom they must discuss their needs in order
to obtain transition information and resources." (p. 143)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At minimum, a close partnership must exist between
educational programs and <acronym title="V.R.">VR</acronym> agencies at the local level to address this
confusion and establish collaborative relationships around individual students
and their families.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">School-agency planning that appears to be supported by the
available research is in the area of career development for individual students
with disabilities.&nbsp; More specifically, planning partners must support students
as they take steps necessary to obtain paid, unsubsidized employment
opportunities prior to graduation.&nbsp; Simply stated, if a student with a
disability works in a job for minimum wage or above, for a period of time prior
to graduation, that same student will greatly increase his or her chances for
employment later on in life.&nbsp; What follows is a review of research that began
in the early 1980s and continues to this day that, demonstrating how this
practice leads to higher employment rates for our graduates. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Nine studies were chosen for this literature review, all of
which were quantitative in nature.&nbsp; Table 1 details the name or the study or
author, the type of study, and the nature of the sample.&nbsp; Five of these studies
were longitudinal samples where graduates with disabilities and significant
people were interviewed to collect comparative data about their current status,
and to discover what factors supported positive outcomes in employment,
postsecondary education and community living.&nbsp; The remaining four studies where
based on an intervention for a group of students, measuring the results in the
short term and at some point in the future.&nbsp; All of these studies in some way
address work experiences for students with disabilities as a part of their
inquiry; seven of the nine studies specifically address the issue of paid
employment while in school.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hasazi, Gordon, and Roe led this well-known longitudinal
study, repeatedly cited in the literature since it was published in 1985. 462
youths were interviewed from nine Vermont school districts. All of these
students had exited high school between 1979 and 1983 and crossed disability
classifications.&nbsp; This study created a benchmark, laying down evidence of a
clear relationship between paid employment while in school, and paid employment
after graduation: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">"The relationship of summer
jobs, school-year part-time jobs, and work experience school programs with
current employment status produced some interesting findings.&nbsp; Of those
students who had no summer jobs, only 37% were employed, versus employment
rates of 46% for those who had subsidized summer jobs and 69% for those who had
nonsubsidized jobs.&nbsp; These relationships were significant and analogous over
all levels of location, gender, and level of functioning." (p. 460)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.2in;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Bellamy (1985) provided expert commentary on this study,

</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">“Holding part-time or summer jobs
during high school was related to employment status, wage level, and percent of
time employed since leaving school.&nbsp; Participation in vocational education was
related to employment status, but no such relationship existed for
participation in work experience programs...It is unclear whether vocational
education and jobs during school are complementary redundant predictors of
employment outcomes.&nbsp; The data do present a challenge to program developers to
capitalize on the possible effects of employment during school, especially
since engaging in subsidized jobs while in school was not associated with the
same postschool employment results as competitive part-time and summer
work." (p. 476)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Through a variety of data collection strategies, the
National Longitudinal Transition Study (<acronym title="N.T.L.S.">NTLS</acronym>) was able to capture data on over
8000 students nationally, across disability groups and other demographic
characteristics. Unfortunately, this study did not differentiate between paid
and unpaid work experience during its interviews with students and their
significant others.&nbsp; However, Heal and Rusch (1995) did present data regarding the
significance of family characteristics:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">"Family characteristics also
were significant predictors of postschool employment.&nbsp; When the block was
entered, household income...was its dominant predictor, suggesting that the
advantages of high socioeconomic status accrue to individuals with as well as
those without disabilities." (p. 484)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This finding was echoed by Newman and Cameto (1993) in their
research on postsecondary education from the NLTS database: "...young
adults in academic programs were significantly more likely to have come from
households with higher incomes than were those who were not attending
postsecondary schools (45% vs. 30%; p&lt;.10)." (p. 13).&nbsp; However, Newman
and Cameto did not find a relationship between high school work experiences (paid
or unpaid) and postsecondary enrollment, opening questions on the effect work
may have on a student’s academic achievement.</p>

Longitudinal Study, which began in 1994, and ended in 2000.&nbsp; This was “...a
multistage, nationally representative, design that initially involved selection
of a random sample of 40 local <acronym title="V.R.">VR</acronym> offices (in 32 state agencies located in a
total of 30 states) and a sample of 8,500 current and former consumers of <acronym title="V.R.">VR</acronym> services."
(p. 4)&nbsp; This comprehensive study addressed “questions of interest to federal
officials in the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services
(<acronym title="O.S.E.R.S.">OSERS</acronym>) concerning the characteristics, services, and outcomes of
transition-aged youth.” (p. iv) &nbsp;In particular, they found that <acronym title="V.R.">VR</acronym> services did
not necessarily lead to a reduced reliance on family and public assistance. Of
those receiving assistance, 78.1% were <acronym title="S.S.A.">SSA</acronym> beneficiaries: "Among youth who
had received special education services in high school, one-third (33.3
percent) were receiving assistance at entry to <acronym title="V.R.">VR</acronym>, and the same proportion
(32.6 percent) continued to receive such assistance following exit from <acronym title="V.R.">VR</acronym>

subjects, and found that only 24.9 percent of special education applicants were
working at the time of application to <acronym title="V.R.">VR</acronym>. However, those who were working at

<p class="MsoNormal">The National Longitudinal Transition Study is just underway,
and promises to look closely at the role of paid employment verses unpaid and other
categories of work.&nbsp; Levine, Marder, and Wagner (2004) provided a glimpse into
the students and former students under review:&nbsp; “NLTS2 is a 10-year study that
is documenting the characteristics, experiences, and outcomes of a nationally
representative sample of more than 11,000 youth who were ages 13 through 16 and
were receiving special education services in grade 7 or above in the 2000-01
school year.” (p. ES-1) Once again, family income is a key concern in the areas
of access to services and employment rates:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">"In the general population,
youth from families with higher incomes have higher rates of employment and
higher wages...This pattern also holds among youth with disabilities... The
1-year employment rate of youth from families with incomes of more than $25,000
is approximately 20 percentage points higher than that of youth from
lower-income families (60% and 64% vs. 42%, p&lt;.001).&nbsp; Current employment
rates of youth with disabilities from families with incomes of more than
$25,000 are more than double that of youth from lower-income families (25% and
30% vs. 12%, p&lt;.001).&nbsp; The percentage of youth earning the minimum wage or
more also is higher among youth in the highest-income group (57%) than among
those in the lowest-income group (41%, p&lt;.05)." (p. 5-9)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The NLTS-2 has already provided detailed information

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">"The vast majority of youth
(91%) who have work-study jobs receive school credit and/or pay for their
work.&nbsp; The most common arrangement, which applies to 48% of work-study students
with disabilities, is to receive school credit but not pay.&nbsp; Another 28%
receive both school credit and pay, and 14% receive pay only." (p. 5-2)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.2in;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">"Paid employment that is not
school related (i.e., not work-study) accounts for the vast majority of the
employment of youth with disabilities who have jobs.&nbsp; According to parents,
somewhat more than half of youth with disabilities (54%) hold regular paid jobs
during a 1-year period, similar to the 50% of the 13- to 17-year-olds in the

<p class="MsoNormal">The Youth Transition Program (<acronym title="Y.T.P.">YTP</acronym>) has been in existence
across several states for over ten years.&nbsp; The program itself contains the
following characteristics:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">"The <acronym title="Y.T.P.">YTP</acronym> provides services to
students beginning during the last 2 years they are in high school and
continuing, if needed during the early transition years after leaving school.&nbsp;
Through the <acronym title="Y.T.P.">YTP</acronym> students receive (a) transition planning focused on postschool
goals and self-determination, and help to coordinate school plans with relevant
adult agencies; (b) instruction in academic, vocational, independent living, and
personal-social content areas, and help to stay in school and obtain a
completion document; (c) paid job training while in the program, and help to
secure employment or enter postsecondary training upon leaving the program; and
(d) follow-up support services for up to 2 years after leaving the program,
provided on an as-needed basis, to help students negotiate the vagaries of the
transition years more effectively and build on the successes they have already
achieved." (p. 512)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This research was conducted on students from the ten year
<acronym title="Y.T.P.">YTP</acronym> database “who exited high school up through the 1997/98 school year
(n=917)…” (p. 513) and achieved a high school diploma.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <acronym title="Y.T.P.">YTP</acronym> seems to
contradict the earlier findings of the NLTS in that students who engage in employment
benefit, not only in their employment rates, but also in their postsecondary
participation rates:&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">"Two program-related variables
predicted student engagement in productive work or continuing education at the
time of program exit...Students who held two or more jobs while in the program
were almost two times more likely to be engaged in work or continuing education
at exit than students who held fewer than two jobs.”&nbsp; (p. 517)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">"The Bridges program consists
of three phases: (a) the pre-vocational orientation program, during which
students and their families are introduced to Bridges and initial vocational
goal-setting activities are conducted (two to three weeks); (b) pre-vocational
preparation, consisting of individual or group career guidance, job
preparation, and job search skills training (two to four weeks); (c) internship
placement and support, which includes specific skills training, monitoring of
students' work performance, and other activities in support of the
employer/employee relationship.&nbsp; The internship is a work experience whereby a
student intern spends a minimum of 12 consecutive weeks performing work tasks
in a community employment setting.&nbsp; The employer pays the wages and benefits
for the student, but the employer and the student are under no obligation to
continue the employment relationship beyond the 12-week period..." (p. 207)</p>

students entering the study 2,524 (83%) of them secured internship positions,
with 2,119 or 84% of those completing the prescribed internship period.&nbsp; 1,586
(75%) of those completing the internship were offered positions within the
original host company.&nbsp; The types of internship positions these participants
secured included a range of jobs in a variety of industries...The average
hourly wage during the internship was $5.40 and the average number of hours
worked was 20.1." (p. 212) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>SUMMARY</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It is clear from the accumulated research that youth and
their families who collaborate with educators, local agency personnel and
businesses are likely to be employed as adults.&nbsp; For the past two decades, a
series of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of students with
disabilities working for pay while attending high school.&nbsp; In most cases, it is
the nature of the support provided to the student on and off the job that makes
the difference between a successful job placement and an unsuccessful one.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Heal, et al (1989) looked at 44 students from 10 states, who were in paid
employment at minimum wage or better, and compared those who were able to
retain their employment with those who were terminated after a short period of
time.&nbsp; They found that the students who retained their jobs beyond six months
had "… transition agency follow-up and supervisor on the job (32.7% for
successful, 46.5% for unsuccessful)."(p. 173)&nbsp; School-<acronym title="V.R.">VR</acronym> agency connections
were emphasized by Szymanski and King (1989) in their description of the role
of the <acronym title="V.R.">VR</acronym> youth counselor:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">"Based on professional
preparation, potential functions include (a) career and psychosocial
counseling; (b) consultation with special and vocational education teachers,
school counselors, and other education professionals regarding the vocational
implications of disability and potential educational adaptations; (c)
coordination of school, family, and community efforts in career planning and
preparation; (d) job placement, job analysis, job modification and
restructuring, and placement follow-up; (e) work adjustment counseling; (f)
coordination of job support services (e.g., job coaches, transportation,
personal care attendants) during transition; (g) referral to and coordination
with adult service agencies; (h) specialized planning and links with
disabilities; and (i) development of individual transition plans ..."

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps some of these roles can be shared among the various
planning partners, including school and community agency personnel, sharing
both the workload and the expense of providing a proven practice.</p>
