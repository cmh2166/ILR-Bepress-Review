MISSION AND VALUES

Cornell University is a learning community that seeks to serve society by educating the leaders of tomorrow and extending the frontiers of knowledge.

In keeping with the founding vision of Ezra Cornell, our community fosters personal discovery and growth, nurtures scholarship and creativity across a broad range of common knowledge, and engages men and women from every segment of society in this quest. We pursue understanding beyond the limitations of existing knowledge, ideology, and disciplinary structure. We affirm the value, to individuals and society, of the cultivation and enrichment of the human mind and spirit.

Our faculty, students and staff strive toward these objectives in a context of freedom with responsibility. We foster initiative, integrity, and excellence, in an environment of collegiality, civility and responsible stewardship. As the Land Grant University for the State of New York, we apply the results of our endeavors in service to the community, the state, the nation and the world.

The Employment and Disability Institute, in the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, holds strongly to these values. Our mission is to provide a learning environment which cultivates inclusive and accessible communities for individuals with disabilities. We seek to provide resources and information to individuals attempting to manage diversity in the workplace, community, and American life. We are committed to ensuring that Americans with disabilities, including youth, are provided with the opportunities and supports needed to attain their goals in settings, environments, cultures and communities of their own choosing — based on their respective interests, preferences, and capacities.

USING PERSON-CENTERED PRACTICES TO FACILITATE THE SUCCESSFUL RE-ENTRY OF INMATES WITH SPECIAL NEEDS INTO COMMUNITY MEMBERSHIP ROLES

A WORKBOOK FOR SUPPORTERS, PLANNERS AND PROVIDERS


Welcome to the “From Inmate to Citizen” Core Training Series. The goal of this series is to develop a learning collaborative between service staff within the correctional system, the parole system and the community at large that facilitates the successful re-entry of inmates with special needs into valued community membership roles upon release from prison.

The series will be conducted over three distinct sessions each comprised of two full days of training to give participants time to learn the material during class time and to apply the material between each session within the day to day operation of a given department. 

Participants will be both learners and teachers throughout the series in order to customize the theories of person-centered approaches to the distinct considerations and conditions of the Special Needs Units across the New York State correctional system.  These efforts will make a remarkable contribution to the existing research pool in this unique area of service delivery to people who have developmental disabilities.

We look forward to taking this journey with you!


This Series was developed by the Community and Workforce Development Unit within the Cornell University Employment and Disability Institute.

It has been sponsored by the NYS Developmental Disabilities Planning Council (Grant #C019652) in conjunction with the NYS Department of Correctional Services and the NYS Division of Parole

A FRAMEWORK FOR PLANNING

Several tools have been developed for the purposes of person-centered planning. All person-centered planning tools are designed to highlight the capacities, talents, unique gifts and abilities of the person who is at the focus or center of the planning process. Each person-centered planning process requires the involvement of skilled facilitators and is comprised of a team of people who know and genuinely care about the focus person.  Any well-facilitated planning effort explores the positive and possible potential for enhancing the quality of life of the focus person, based upon the person's expressed interest for participating in the process.

Each one of the different tools helps the planner gain clarity or focus.   PATH planning (Pearpoint, O'Brien, Forest), for example, helps the planner to create a crisp vision around an partially formulated idea or ideal and creates a pathway for moving toward the vision.  Personal Future's Planning (Mount), helps the planner to think about the kind of life he or she would like to experience at home, in the community, and/or at work.  Essential Lifestyles Planning, (Smull), helps the planner identify basic quality indicators that he or she wants to experience in every day life.  Choosing which tool to use depends upon what the focus person is hoping to get out of the process.  


The Framework for Planning, (Blessing, Ferrell), was developed to provide a structured approach to helping people with disabilities think about their life focus or direction when they simply do not have any idea about how to begin thinking about such things.  Although specifically designed as a guide for thinking about goals and aspirations with people whose life choices have been, or are restricted or limited, the Framework for Planning has been used successfully to help groups form a vision for strategic planning; with family members thinking about transition stages such as retirement options and with people who are not living with a label of a disability but who are seeking a stronger sense of self and purpose in life.  

The Framework for Planning tool is a vital resource in developing a positive personal profile with people who have solid experience in being viewed and defined by the things that they could not do or whose personhood has historically been defined by the presence of a disability.  When completed, the Framework reveals a capacity view of the focus person as well as surfacing the driving values and interests that resonate with the individual.  As with all person-centered planning methods, the Framework for Planning relies on the input from the person's support network and culminates in the development of an initial plan for action.  

Once the majority of the tool has been completed, the information is synthesized into a working plan.  Ideas for ways in which the focus person might make his or her contribution to community life are drawn from the interests and priorities, values and ideals that emerge throughout the planning process.  The individual and the team brainstorm places in the community in which the individual's gifts, talents and capacities might be acknowledged, welcomed and appreciated and where opportunities for building relationships of reciprocity exist.  The focus person decides what, if any of the ideas are worth exploring and these decisions determine the direction the person wishes to pursue in his or her life.  These ideas are then translated into action steps for moving forward.  The support team works with the focus person to identify other people and/or associations that should be invited into the process because they have interest, expertise or can assist the person in moving forward toward the identified goal or goals.

For example, one planning process conducted in Western New York yielded a plan with a young man, Robert, who discovered that he was very determined in beginning his own business as an artisan.   Since Robert knew nothing about starting or running a business, or how to begin to think about turning his craft into a livelihood, some of the first steps for action included:

* Research into small business ventures - obtain on-line resources from the library;
* Talk with a local artisan who was running a successful business and with whom Robert had a long-standing relationship as this man's customer - find out if this man would be willing to discuss the ins and outs of running such a venture with Robert and/or explore the possibility of this man becoming a mentor to Robert by letting Robert apprentice with him for a time
* Engage in a PATH planning process to develop a vision and a strategic plan for the business 
* Find part-time employment in town at any of the local craft supplier retail markets

All of the steps articulated in Robert's plan clearly require distinctly different skill sets and expertise to carry them out.  People who are known to have such skills and who share mutual interest are invited into the process to assist the person move through a particular phase.  With the exception of the focus person and his or her long-term supporters (i.e. partner, sibling, friends, parents, etc.), membership within the team will ideally change as progress is being made and different skills and expertise are needed.


Person-centered planning methods rely on a clearly defined purpose for engaging in the process. The person who is at the focus of the planning process describes what it is that they hope to learn from the experience. The purpose sets the context for the conversations and information gathering that will occur throughout the planning session.   Once defining a purpose for engaging in the process, one of the intentional outcomes of the Framework for Planning is to emerge with a draft plan of action to set the wheels in motion toward realizing the focus person's individual capacities and potential for making valuable contributions as a member of society.




ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES OF FRAMEWORK PLANNERS

The Framework for Planning uses seven distinct areas through which information is gathered about the focus person. These areas, Attributes & Capacities; Interests; Values & Ideals; Priorities; Networks & Resources; Supports, and; Community Connectedness, come together to form a positive reflection of the person and a sense of direction for building connections to citizenship and community inclusion. 
 
In addition to the focus person who has identified a purpose for planning, engaging in the Framework for Planning process requires the use of a process facilitator, a process recorder, and a team of people who have committed to assisting the person in moving the action plan forward. These roles are critical to the successful completion of a positive profile and in moving the plan into action.

The responsibilities of the process facilitator role include: 

* Explaining the process to the focus person in such a way that the individual is able to make an informed decision about whether or not they want to participate in the planning process,
* Supports the focus person to establish a purpose for engaging in the planning;
* Supporting the focus person in developing a list of names of the people she/he would like to contribute to the process;
* Establishing and maintaining ground rules for group behavior,
* Keeping the focus person at the center of the process, enabling this voice to rise above others while maintaining respect and preserving the dignity of the focus person;
* Ensuring a safe and positive environment for the focus person and guest participants;
* Focusing the process on the purpose for planning;
* Supporting the process recorder role.


The responsibilities for the process recorder role include:

* Replicating the Framework template on newsprint pages (large enough for people to see clearly from all vantage points) and posting it on the wall for public record;
* Records the information that is being gathered accurately and legibly;
* Records full thoughts of the participants without assuming meaning or assigning value;
* Summarizes the group work to ensure accuracy, clarity;
* Supports the process facilitator role.

While the process recording and facilitation roles are crucial to developing a clear plan, it is the person and the person's network of support, or support team that bring the plan to life.  

A plan without action is nothing more than a waste of time and leads to disappointment and disillusionment for the focus person and his or her network of support.  If there is no commitment for action DO NOT engage in person-centered planning!
 
The role of the support team includes:
* Willingness to let the focus person set and lead the agenda.
* Engaging in active and respectful listening.
* Willingness to focus on the positive and possible with the focus person.
* Making meaningful and relevant contributions.
* Commitment to assisting the focus person in setting and taking action steps.
* Participating in subsequent meetings until involvement is no longer needed.
* Follow through on commitments.

A word about teams:  traditional teams are typically comprised of individuals who are assigned to the team by virtue of the job description. For instance, a social worker may attend team meetings because the person is on the social worker's caseload, not because the agenda for the meeting holds any particular need for the skills and expertise the social worker brings. Often, membership on the team does not extend 
beyond the people who are paid to be in the person's life.  Any plan for action that emerges from these meetings generally means that those who attended the meeting will have to do all of the work. The person-centered team seeks to incorporate others into the team based upon their ability to be instrumental in contributing to the skill, ability and expertise necessary for assisting the person's progression toward the goal. While there may be times when a specific skill is needed from a particular member of the team of support, the basic function of the team is to act as a conduit for developing and accessing needed resources.  

The team takes its direction from the focus person.  It is the job of the focus person to set the direction and pace for the team's work.  Additionally, the focus person is responsible for:
* Identifying people to invite into the network of support.
* Working with the facilitators in designing the planning session and subsequent meetings.
* Openly sharing ideas, interests and aspirations.
* Actively participating in selecting goals and objectives.
* Follow through on commitments.
* Providing honest feedback to the team 
* Negotiating agreements and understandings with the team.



PROTOCOL FOR COMPLETING THE FRAMEWORK FOR PLANNING

Completing the Framework for Planning involves engaging the focus person and invited participants in a process of exploration and discovery through the facilitation of questions, dialogue and storytelling.  Using the stated purpose for planning as the context in which to set the dialogue, the process facilitator will weave back and forth across the Framework areas to draw information out of the focus person and his or her support team. 

The general protocol for completing the Framework for Planning is to begin with surfacing the focus person's capacities.  Asking the support team to identify what are good qualities about the person helps to set a positive tone for and about the focus person, as well as engaging all participants in the process very quickly.  Interests, talents and hobbies of the person will often crop up during the capacity search.  The process recorder should be listening and recording information across the Framework template as participants and the focus person are talking.  Recurring themes will be recorded within the Priorities section or may be evidenced as the Values and Ideals of the person.  

Enough information has been gathered about the qualities, interests, and capacities of the person when a clear and positive profile of the person can be seen.  When this occurs, it is time to move toward identifying the 
resources the person already has in his or her life and the type and frequency of support the person most benefits from.  Resources include people who are involved in the person's life, assets the person has such as a driver's license, a car, a house, a job, associations in which the person is involved, etc.  The Supports section of the Framework is completed from the perspective of what the focus person indicates good support does or should look like.  What helps the person to be and feel successful? What makes for more good days than bad days? What type of person does the individual prefer to be around? What does a good work/home/ leisure environment offer?

The last step in completing the Framework for Planning template is Community Connectedness.  The process facilitator helps the team to synthesize all of the information that has been gathered thus far into theme areas that represent a good profile of who the person "is," what gifts the person has to offer the world and the clear values, traditions and priorities that must be honored.  It is this synthesis that leads the group toward brainstorming ideas around the valued roles the person might take on in the community and where in the natural community those roles might find kindred and welcome spirit.  While the rest of the Framework sets the direction for planning it is this section of the template that yields a draft plan for taking action.  The last step of the planning is the first step towards realizing the goal.




GUIDELINES FOR USING THE SAMPLE QUESTIONS

A sample set of questions for each part of the framework has been developed as a resource to help facilitators who are uncertain about how to get started begin the dialogue for each of the sections of the template.  These sample questions are included in the appendix section of this workbook.  Facilitators and planners who will be using the sample questions are asked to respect the following associated guidelines:  

Framework Question Guidelines

* The questions are merely guideposts for discovering important information about people. They are not required questions. If the questions are used they are to be used as a way to begin a dialogue with a person that leads to deeper awareness and understanding of the person.

* The questions should be used as a springboard for the facilitator to develop his or her own list of questions specific to the person with whom planning is being done.

* Questions should intentionally create a safe and caring atmosphere.  The 
individual does not have to answer any question s/he doesn't want to answer.

* The facilitator is not limited to these questions.


* Questions should be open-ended.

* The Three Approaches to a Conversation (www.allenshea.com) techniques should be used.

* Questions should be adapted/developed to include the people who know and care about the focus person.


* Questions must always be geared toward seeing the person through the lens of capacity.

* Any answer that is recorded from the questions must reflect the person's true response.  This means the facilitator must make sure that s/he has clearly understood the person's point by getting the person's approval to record the response.

* The facilitator clearly understands the difference between "public" information and "private" information.

DEVELOPING POSITIVE PERSONAL PROFILES


Developing service plans for people with disabilities has traditionally been a process of identifying the deficits in the person's ability to perform in ways that are perceived as typical or normal.  People are assessed and evaluated against a socially defined standard of "normal" and strategies are designed to intervene and fix the problem.  An unfortunate consequence of this approach is that people with disabilities then do not fit within the flow of the mainstream of society and are left to, at best, observe community life from the side lines or at worse, to be cast out beyond the margins of typical communities.  This is the phenomenon of exclusion.

Person-centered practices seek to reverse the trend of excluding people who have labels of disabilities from typical society.  Rather, 
the focus is on looking for the capacities and giftedness inherent in all human beings and to bring these forward as a conduit for making connections and contributions to 
community living, learning and earning.  The goal of person-centered practices is inclusion. The foundation for inclusion is built on the belief that all people belong in our communities. All people. All ways.

The need to feel that one belongs is a basic human need and one that must be met before a person can achieve a sense of self-worth.  Belonging is a cornerstone of inclusion.  

The art of facilitating inclusion requires that people work together to realign the perceptions and expectations that one holds about people who are missing ordinary gifts and who are given labels to discriminate them from those whose disabilities are yet to be revealed.  The charge for inclusion is to discover along with the person what his or her gifts are and to find the places, and to be among the people where sincere interest, genuine appreciation and opportunity for exchange come together. A vehicle for the discovery of capacities and positive potential lies within the development of positive personal profiles.

Positive personal profiles are a snapshot of the strengths and capacities of the person; of the person's interests and talents; of the person's preferences and priorities; and of the support the person requires due to the impact of disability to fully participate in and contribute to daily life. They are "asset-focused" while highlighting important and necessary considerations for balancing a desired lifestyle with health and safety.  

Your beliefs are very powerful and have the power to create or to destroy your life. In most cases, whatever you believe, is what you will become. If you believe that you are loser, that you never get a break in life, that you can't accomplish anything, these things will be your reality. Believe that you are unlimited, that you can do anything you commit to doing, and when you do, your accomplishments will know no bounds.  ~Chetan Chopra, Ph.D

Positive personal profiles can be completed in one session or over several sessions.  Most important to the development of the profile is that the input from people who know, love and care about the individual at the focus of the profile development are included in the process.

The positive profile provides an opportunity to facilitate a process that puts the person in the center of positive focus and attention.  Together with the facilitator, the person, along with the people who are invited into the team process create an overview description of the strengths, attributes, interests, priorities of the focus person.

The profile process helps us to:

* Get to know and listen to a person
* Develop a shared appreciation of the person
* Identify the positive attributes and capacities of the person
* Identify the barriers and the struggles the person is facing
* Include and value the input from others who know and who care about the person
* Empower the person by creating the conditions for his or her voice to be heard above others with regard to interests and preferences and naming things that are getting in the way of expressing their capacity
                 (Mount, 2000)


Positive personal profiles reinforce belief in the right to belong.

One way to begin developing a positive profile with a person is to convene a group of people around the person. This group should be comprised of individuals who have genuine positive regard of the focus person and who care about the person.  Facilitate a 15- 20 minute session that fills the room up with the individual's positive qualities and characteristics.  Use large newsprint and plenty of color to capture words that describe the focus person.  

Ask the group to tell you what they really like about the focus person. Ask what is admirable about the person.  Find out what words people feel best describe the "essence" of the person's positive nature.  



ATTRIBUTES AND CAPACITIES

Typical methods for getting to know about a person generally focus on collecting data through a repertoire of standardized tests and assessments. While statistically relevant for certain measures, these approaches are often designed toward identifying the gap - or deviation - in the range of performance function and/or intellectual capacity that appears to exist between the person/subject and what is accepted as the normal population. The logical extension, once the standard deviation is determined, is to then introduce some intervention that is designed to close the gap by building the capacity of the person/subject to be more like what is accepted as the norm.

One of the inherent problems with traditional tests and assessments that rely on such normative standards lies in the generally accepted idea of what is and is not "normal."  Almost without question a person who falls on the less statistically common side of the scale is considered to have a problem that must be addressed.   

In contrast, the development of a positive personal profile on behalf of or with an individual does not rely solely on the traditional programmatic approaches to finding out about a person.    It requires understanding a person from the perspective of their individual identity, attributes, capacities and giftedness. It is a process of discovery that surfaces and reinforces the "who" of the focus person so that connections can be made (rather than gaps analyzed and eliminated) between the individual and others that share common interests, values, talents and skills.  The positive personal profile helps to find direction for supporting people toward full membership within the heart of community.

Many of us have been raised in a culture that encourages and rewards competition 
Believing is seeing.  What people choose to believe about the potential of another human being will have an impact on the future that the person will ultimately experience. The positive personal profile surfaces the capacity, potential and human spirit that dwells in all people and creates opportunity for building and connecting to communities that believes in and sees the best in all of its members.

INTERVIEWING TIPS FOR COMPLETING EXERCISES

Skilled interviewer techniques needed to gather information during the planning process include finding a variety of ways for getting information to surface.  In Three Approaches to a Conversation, (1996) Michael Smull describes three methods for gathering information about a person based on a single question.

Linear
A linear approach is the easiest way to have a conversation without asking leading questions. If you are talking with the individual with whom you are planning you simply start with getting up and then walk through the day with the person. You ask what a "typical" morning is like and then ask if some are better than others and what is a good one like and what is a bad one like. You move through the day in pieces asking for what usually happens and then asking for good and bad versions of that part of the day. Try to get the person you are talking with to tell you stories that illustrate what they mean. Be prepared to adapt this approach to the circumstances and capacities of the person. One man could not tell us what a good or bad day was like but he could describe his last week, day by day, in great detail. Another man had not had any good days in some time but could tell us about good days from his past. When talking with someone who is involved during regular hours (e.g. 9 AM to 3 PM) simply start at the beginning of that time and walk through it asking questions about typical, good, and bad versions of each part of the day. 

Branching
A branching approach starts in the same way, walking through time with the person, encouraging stories that illustrate the good day and the bad day. However, in a branching approach you look for opportunities for the person to tell related stories about other parts of a person's life. The result is a conversation that branches from one point in time and then meanders a bit until that line of conversation end. At that point you go back to where you where in time when the branch started. For example, if the branch started with breakfast and wandered off from there, at the end of that branch you would ask "and what happens after breakfast?"



Meandering
A meandering conversation is the most natural and also the most difficult. In a meandering conversation, instead of walking through time with someone, you start wherever your initial questions lead you and then shape the conversation so that you hear stories about is important to the individual's life across all of the areas that the person you are interviewing knows about. Having a meandering conversation requires that you keep the conversation moving and cover all the areas in the time that you have. The facilitator must be skilled and have a mental map of what she or he wants to learn, while always listening for the unexpected.

EXERCISE:  MORNING ROUTINE

From the time we are infants to the time we are in our later years we rely on routine and rituals to provide us with security and comfort.  Routine helps us to tolerate frustration, sleep in comfort, handle difficult transitions and adjust to new circumstances and environments.

Our individual routines and rituals tell a lot about what matters to us in our immediate corner of the world.  We honor routines on a daily basis, most of the time without even knowing it!  

The morning routine exercise, (Smull, Essential Lifestyles Planning), is one example of how routines and rituals are a very real part of how we make our way through the day.  Combined with other person-centered processes, this exercise can open understanding and awareness about the priorities and preferences we have that define the quality of our lives.

Carol's Morning Routine:

6:15	Radio Alarm - Classic Rock
6:25	Dress for Exercise, make water, 
      "morning" to Jim
6:30	Start music, begin Exercise Routine- 
      stretch/bike/stretch/"meditate"
7:30	Wait for Kathy (ride) with Jess
      Bye to Jess ("kiss-kiss") 
      Bye to Jim ("love you!")
      Call to Jen to make sure she's up
7:40	Shower - hot!
8:00	Dress for day (mood)
8:10	Nag Jen to finish/make lunch
      Turn on computer (or gather meeting
      materials)
      Heat water for tea
8:25	Wait for bus with Jen  play the "See Ya Wouldn't Want to Be Ya" game
8:30	Bus comes
8:30	Grab toast w/peanut butter, ice water, tea……………Go to work


Directions:

1. Take a large piece of newsprint and a marker. Note: pens/pencils and light colored markers do not work well.  
2.  Write your name at the top of the page
3.  Beginning with the time you get out of bed on a typical work- day to the time you leave for work, list the routine you usually follow. Note: be as specific as you can be but do not include information that you do not want others to see. Note: indicate at least the start and end time to your routine. 
4.  Post your finished routine on the wall and stand with it for the next part of the exercise. 


EXERCISE:  PREFERENCES


Framework for Planning Worksheet #3:

After reviewing the morning routine exercise for themes around preferences and priorities, complete this section of the worksheet for yourself.
    
GOTTA HAVE….

(these are the things/events that there is no way you imagine living without)


* ______________________________________________________________________________

* ______________________________________________________________________________

* ______________________________________________________________________________

* ______________________________________________________________________________

* ______________________________________________________________________________

* ______________________________________________________________________________

* ______________________________________________________________________________

* ______________________________________________________________________________



Directions:

1. Work with a partner to review each other's morning routines.
2. Note any theme that seems to be prevalent on your partner's routine. 
3. Have a conversation you’re your partner about what you see in and how you interpret the morning routine:
* What seems to be important to the person to have or to do?
* Is there anything that seems to enhance the quality of the day for the person?
* What does the morning routine seem to say about what the person cares about?
* Be sure that your partner clarifies/corrects/confirms your interpretations
* Work together to complete the worksheet by prioritizing preferences along the categories provided.



VALUES AND IDEALS

Values can be defined as those things that are important to us. They are the consistent force embedded in our conscious and subconscious behavior.  They are the beliefs we hold onto when faced with great uncertainty. They are the benchmarks for our decision-making and the reason behind the choices we make. They are the corner stones of our character.  Our values create the core of who we are in the world.

For many people whose lives have been deeply influenced by the impact of disability discovering or defending what she or he "stands for" may be a significant challenge.  In extreme situations, the values of people whose lives depend primarily on a system of professional support may be quite literally and completely disregarded.  Consider the 400 suitcases discovered in 1995 in the attic of a New York state psychiatric center.  These suitcases held the possessions of former patients of the hospital. These possessions, ranging from photographs, poetry, musical scores, and bibles to sewing material, uniforms, medals, letters and books, revealed the personality and humanity of their owner. They tell the story of person-hood, of a life before patient-hood.  Upon admittance to the Willard Psychiatric Center, located 65 miles southwest of Syracuse, New York, the  individual relinquished the artifacts of their life story and donned the status of disability.  No patient residing at the hospital ever saw the contents of their suitcase again.  During its years of operation, from 1869-1995, more than 50,000 men and women passed though the doors of the hospital. (Williams, 2004 "Lost Cases, Recovered Lives: Suitcases from a State Hospital Attic").  

Helping people identify their core values is central to discovering where and how a person's attributes, capacities, interests and skills might be woven into the fabric of community life.  Values serve to shape or reinforce the vision one holds of the purpose for one's life.  True vision can not exist for anyone without recognizing and respecting our core values.

Consider how you might answer the following questions:

* What would a perfect day be like for you?
* Name someone you would consider a hero.  Why?
* What do you hope to be the "footprint" of your life--your mark in this world?
* What is your favorite season of the year? Why?

The answer to any/all of these questions gives insight into what you believe and care about; the qualities of your life that you value.  It is this essence of who you are that has been, (and probably will always be), part of you for as long as you can remember or imagine.

What lies beneath us, and what lies before us, are tiny matters compared to what lies within us. ~ Author unknown


A society that does not recognize that each individual has values of his own which he is entitled to follow can have no respect for the dignity of the individual. -F.A. Hayek

Directions:

1. Rejoin the partner with whom you have been working throughout this session
2. Each of you has been given a card with a written statement or a question on it. You will need to take turns for this exercise so decide which of you will go first. 
3. Read the statement/question on the card first to yourself and then aloud to your partner
4. Discuss your response/thoughts about the question or statement on the card with your partner
5. Listener should be asking questions to gain deeper understanding and insight into the speaker's beliefs/values.
6. Repeat the process so that each partner has read and responded to the statement or question on the card
7. When you are finished, complete the questions on the Framework for Planning Worksheet #4 in your workbook



EXERCISE:  PRIORITIES PART I

SCENARIO:

You have been selected to prepare a time capsule of Universal Truth that will be placed in a safe deposit box with instructions that it will not be opened for 100 years.  Your time capsule will hold the secrets based upon your life experience that you know that if followed, are sure to lead to universal happiness.  If they are not followed, there is no doubt that universal death and destruction will result.  

Since the time capsule has the capacity to store only 3 suggestions, you must list your selections in the order of importance.  Number 1 will represent your highest priority.  

Use the following list to help prioritize the elements that you believe must be placed in the time capsule. Rank them in order of importance to you.  Feel free to add elements that did not surface in the list. 



__Family
__Nature
__Education
__Food/Shelter
__Friends
__Compassion
__Interests
__Pride
__Career/Jobs
__Competition
__Diversity
__Leadership
__Influence
__Tradition
__Fortune/Wealth
__Success
__Spirituality
__Independence
__Purpose
__Freedom
__Spouse/Partner
__Security
__Children
__Technology
__Exercise
__Knowledge
__Justice
__Experience

__Recreation/Hobbies
__Beauty

__Power
__Art

__Other(Name It)________________
				


EXERCISE:  PRIORITIES PART II


List the top 3 priorities for the Time Capsule.  Think about and be prepared to discuss with your group why you believe these to be critical elements for creating universal happiness.  

Time Capsule Priority #1:



Time Capsule Priority #2:



Time Capsule Priority #3:   




When you have completed the individual and small group exercises, fill in the Priority section of your Framework for Planning template based on your personal priorities.  If some of your priorities are also values, add them to the Values section as well.



DEVELOPING A PROFILE

You are at the half-way point of completing your own Framework for Planning.  Like engaging in all person-centered planning methods, there must be a purpose for conducting process. Your PURPOSE for engaging in all of this work is to learn about the Framework as you walk through each of the steps of the Framework for Planning process.  There is no better teacher than experience. This is particularly true when working in person-centered planning with and on behalf of individuals who experience community life as an observer rather than as a player.  It is important to know what it feels like to have to think about life-defining beliefs and interests and to have to answer personal questions about these things before we ask others to answer our questions of them. Often people who live with disabilities are accustomed to being asked to reveal private information by the people who support them (and usually this is done in groups at meetings) who may inadvertently do this without conscious regard for the individual's personal boundaries.  

Additionally, imagine how sitting in a process such as this might feel for someone who might be lacking a strong sense of self?  What about the person whose life experiences have left them dependent upon the values and beliefs of others? What about the person who has never before been asked questions like these?  Where would they find the answers?  


When we ourselves understand what it feels like to be the focus of such attention-even such positive attention as developing a positive profile brings-we become better facilitators. We remember our humanness.  

Another purpose for completing the exercises and activities embedded in this workbook is to provide you with your own Positive Profile.  What you bring to the table is a unique blend of talents and skills, interests and preferences, resources and support that promise to make a vital contribution to the ability of the learning community to successfully move a process like this within and beyond the typical service delivery system.  

Look back over the Framework for Planning template that you have completed for yourself up to this point.  When you look at the whole of the information from a general point of view, what does the information seem to say about who you are; what matters to you; what drives you and where your energy lies?  These can be considered some main "themes."  There can usually be found three or four strong themes at this stage in the process. Strong themes are those values, interests, and/or priorities that seem to recur across many of the sections of the template. Examples of some strong themes might be:  must help others; family is of primary importance; prefers to keep busy; must engage in on-going personal development; loves to organize; etc.

________________________________________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________________________


A really bad day is when these things happen:

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________





Directions:

1. Complete Worksheet #6 individually and with input from your partner if needed

2. Return to the small group for a general discussion of the exercise.  Did the exercise surface anything that surprised you?  Did it serve to reinforce what you already know about yourself?  How hard/easy was it to pull "themes" from your own framework? Was it easier to see your partners themes than it was to see your own?



SUPPORT PLANNING

For decades the rehabilitation model has been used to design support services for people who experience life with disability.   Rehabilitative services are designed with the presumption that people with disabilities can function more normally in the world around them if attention is paid to plugging the gaps that are created by the impact of a disability.  Deficits, impediments or barriers to what is perceived as normal functioning are targeted areas for goal development and action planning.

If support planning is the target for rehabilitation services it is important to take a look at just what it may mean, by definition, to "rehabilitate" someone.  

A web search produced the following definition for rehabilitation as it applied to human beings:

1.  (n) the restoration of someone to a useful place in society;

2.  (n) the treatment of physical disabilities by massage, electrotherapy and exercise;

3.  (n) vindication of the person's character and the reestablishment of that person's reputation.
(www.hyperdictionary.com)

The first definition most closely describes the system of service and support that is offered to people whose disability primarily affects their intellectual capacity, mental health, and/or visual or auditory capacity.  The second definition describes the type of rehabilitative services that are available to people whose disability, whether temporary or permanent, is of a physical nature. Of course there are hybrids of services and supports that exist for people who have more than one classification of a disability.  The course of treatment or intervention follows a prescribed pathway to meeting either definition.  The critical point is that it is the disability and the subsequent "fix" for the disability that is the focus for the service.  An unintended consequence to working from these definitions is that personhood takes a back seat to patient-hood or client-hood.  In a very real sense, the person becomes the disability. Think for a moment.  If you have ever heard variations of these themes: "I work with behavior problems," "the blind girl,"  "the Down's kid," or the "borderline," then you have a good picture of the collateral damage caused by good intentions.

The third definition of rehabilitation is the definition that most closely aligns with the values and intended outcomes for person-centered practices.  It focuses the service and support on discovering the positive character and reputation of a person.  Through working toward achieving this definition of rehabilitation a person's potential does not get lost, it gets found. 

Planning within the context of the third definition leads toward the identification of the type, kind and frequency of support that works best in assisting a person to be as fully engaged in life activities as possible.  The focus is on maximizing the potential for the person to make his or her contributions as citizens.  In this view, there are no gaps to be plugged. There is the presumption of capacity.



IMPORTANT TO AND IMPORTANT FOR…FINDING BALANCE IN PLANNING SUPPORT

Traditional service plans are replete with goals and objectives that are designed to address what paid professionals and other experts see as what is important for the person to accomplish in light of the disability.  For an example, a common goal for people who are in recovery from addiction is the abstinence from the addictive substance. Most rational people would agree that it is important for that person to abstain if they are to move toward recovery.  This is an obvious premise that carries with it obvious interventions:  attend group meetings; attend counseling; get a sponsor; avoid triggers; etc.  Clear. Obvious. Precise.  

So why, for countless numbers of people, doesn't it work?

Providing a plan of support or a plan for intervention based solely on the factor that is important for the person does not work unless it is combined with another condition - the condition that it is important TO the person to engage in the recovery process.   In a very real sense there must be a motivating factor, a higher purpose, for accepting and "working" the program.  Except in rare cases, good intentions are not enough to keep a person on the road to recovery.

It is not enough to focus support planning with people that is rooted in the belief that the person must prove that they are motivated to change by meeting certain criteria (i.e. attend every group session) from the important for column before moving toward realizing the kind of life described in the important to column. 

Neither is it enough to focus solely on what is important to the person.  Paying exclusive attention to what the person wants without attending to what the person needs in order to successfully accomplish the goal is not only dangerous, it is down right irresponsible! 

This requires service providers to think beyond an either/or approach to planning which places greater weight on one of the areas of importance over the other.  Example: "After you have been clean and sober for 1 year, we will discuss how your can work on getting your children back."  Translation: "When you have taken care of what is important for you (our perspective), we will look at what is important to you (your perspective).

Finding the balance between the two becomes the fulcrum for motivation. The role of the service provider is to assist the person in finding such balance:  " In order to regain custody of my children I need to be clean and sober for one year." It is the ability to find the answer to two questions at the same time:  How do we support the person to be able to have the life they want AND do this in the context of health and safety?

COMMUNICATION AND SUPPORT

The idea of building communities in which all of its members are welcome elicits reactions from anyone whose opinion is invited.  Some reactions are more extremely opposed to the idea than others.  Some reactions are more positively idealistic. Many reactions reflect uncertainty and a willingness to support inclusion under the right conditions.

In theory, fully inclusive communities, is endorsable and feels like the right thing to do.  At the practical level, however, we have to admit that we each draw a line in the sand when it comes to who we want living in our neighborhoods.  These boundaries or lines in the sand serve to identify those we would wish to exclude from the community for very personally and socially justifiable reasons.  It would be a simple task to create a list of the people who present far too great a risk to be allowed into the mainstream of community living.  Serial killers, drug addicts, child abusers, rapists, mental patients….  It is easy to exclude such people because the plain fact of the matter is that we do not know how to include them into our own lives safely.  

If we did know how to help people curb their unsafe impulses, their involvement in our communities would excite fewer passions because we would be able to move past the behavior and find the person with a kind of certainty and confidence that we do not currently possess.

Sadly, when we as human beings are confronted with our unknowing, such as not knowing how to teach children whose particular learning style is not widely recognized, we fashion a divide between our selves and the child.  In the beginning, we are not afraid of the child.  We are afraid of accepting what we do not know.  When the divide between the child and us is deep enough, fear of the child takes hold. The distance between us is too far to cross.  It is much safer to draw a line.

That inclusion requires behavior changes is without question. The question, if we dare to ask it, is concerned with whose behavior requires the change.   It is often the assumed role of the service providers to decide that people with behavioral differences have to change to meet the generally accepted conditions for social inclusion.  For years this assumption has provided the foundation and rationale for erecting buildings, cultivating professional pathways and developing programs that are designed to get people ready to someday join the rest of the world.  Billions of dollars have been spent to insure that the divide between them and us is deep and wide enough.

Extreme behavior can almost always be traced back to the experience of not being listened to because the message sounded alien against the ears that represent the social status quo.  Taking even one step toward opening the boundaries, erasing the line in the sand or filling in some of the divide will require a new form of listening on all of our parts.  The new listening must arise from a true desire for change.  A change that reflects the values and principles of social inclusion and a redefinition of what we as a society think is really important.  (Lovette, 1996)

ELP Learning Community


COMMUNICATION CHART - DIRECTIONS

The Communication Chart is an alternative to traditional approaches to resolving concerns over a person's behavior.   Its purpose is to help identify respectful approaches to positive behavioral support that are responsive to the "voice" behind the behavior.  It draws together people who are concerned about addressing the behavior and who are willing to seek greater understanding and insight about what the behavior may be representing for the person.

The Communication Chart, developed by the ELP Learning Community, is one tool to help people begin to listen to the message of behavior.  It is useful to use the Communication Chart to help

* define how someone may communicate when they are not thinking clearly
* give supporters and friends concrete steps to take
* provides a forum for directing what support needs to look like

How to use the Communication Chart

Determining who should be involved in the problem-solving process is the first step in using the Communication Chart.  Generally, the people who are most affected by the impact of the behavior is a good place to start.  It is important to think past the immediate group to include other people 
who know and who care about the person for many reasons:


1. reflect a better balance in the perspective others hold of the person;
2. generates more ideas and surfaces different insights;
3. fosters collaboration and continuity across environments
4. serves as a source of support to the members of the team

A word of caution:  the Communication Chart must always be used in the context of finding a way toward positive support.  If not carefully facilitated the problem-solving team can quite easily become an angry/frustrated group and use the chart to seek restitution.  Select a skilled facilitator. Make sure that the skilled facilitator is not someone who is connected to the problem.

Replicate the Communication Chart template in a public format.  Use a chalkboard, grease board or newsprint and post it in a central location.  This will keep people focused on the discussion as well as literally being "on the same page."

Begin in the middle.  . Initially everyone will believe that they are in agreement about what the problem is but in all probability each member will have a different perspective about what, for them, is the real issue. Consequently, each member is asked to describe what he or she sees as the problem behavior. Tip:  The facilitator should use a separate sheet of newsprint to record these views as a method to assist participants in developing a clear definition of what they see as the problem.  Since everyone in the room is affected by the problem, it is important that everyone has a chance to contribute to defining the problem area(s).  There may be consensus around one definition for the "problem," or it may be realized that there are several different problems that warrant attention.  Each identified issue receives its own place on the chart under the heading "____ does this"found in the second column on the chart, and is reviewed as an independent entity.



when this is    		----- does       		we think    and we 
happening              		this…     		it means    should do
                      
       steals office
                      	supplies from
                      	supervisor

                     	 punches
                  
                      	screams 
                     	 profanities
                    

Having found definition of the problem(s), a distinct conversation for each one is facilitated.  The third column on the chart, "we think it means (or --- has told us it means)"  is used next.



when this is    		does               we think        and we 
happening      		this…             it means         should do
                     	 
       steals office    	hates sup.
                      	supplies          wants status
                       	from              wants 
                      	supervisor       	authority
	
Once again, everyone on the team provides an opinion about what they think is the motivation behind the behavior.  Each contribution is recorded in the third column.

Next the group is asked to identify what they have observed to be occurring that seemed to provoke the behavior.  Perhaps it is brought on when the person is around specific individuals or groups?  Does the behavior occur before, during or after a routine event?  Does it seem ignited by personal interactions? Which ones?  Each response is recorded under the "when this is happening" section of the chart.

The last column of the Communication Chart asks that the group read across the information that they have surfaced and to determine if the "best guesses" (hypotheses), represented on the chart seem valid enough to orchestrate support around (plan).  Note that the heading of this column reads "and we should do…" rather than identifying what the person needs to do. This is the critical crux of the chart.  Repeat the strategizing for each identified behavior and correlated responses.

happening      		this…             it means      	should do

Next, the group moves toward consensus around what themes have emerged that can serve as the basis for a reasonable hypothesis: wants to be recognized as a leader; has a desire for autonomy; hates to be told what to do.  

The facilitator uses these themes to set the context for the final step of the process: develop strategies to test the hypotheses. 


Example:  Peter seems to hate authoritarian structures.  When he is told what to do rather than being a partner in the process, he rebels.  Often his rebellion includes damaging or theft of property.. It is always the property of any figure he sees in an authority role but not necessarily the property of the person Peter is angry with. Occasionally his response is more extreme and he may hurt himself or other people. It is important to find ways in which Peter can have a say in what he is being asked to do.  People who support Peter will need to be willing and able to negotiate with him effectively and fairly.

Strategy 1: Ask for Peter's help in determining to what work area he might like to be assigned

Strategy 2: Ask for Peter's help in making recommendations for working effectively with his current supervisor

Strategy 3: identify tasks in the work area in which Peter can take a leadership role 

It is the job of the group to test the hypotheses through implementation of the strategies.  The facilitator sets a follow up meeting so that the participants can re-convene after a reasonable trial period to discuss what is working or not working and to adjust support as necessary.

Like any hypotheses, the Communication Chart helps people to formulate a set of "best guesses."  There is no guarantee that these guesses are accurate or that if they are accurate the strategies are the right ones.  Traditional approaches to addressing behavioral concerns rely on methods that are designed to put the person in the bulls eye of the problem and to target the interventions at the person. The contention behind the Communication Chart is that there is a higher probability of success when people are committed to identifying the underlying problem from the person's perspective as the bulls eye and then stand together to target the strategies that will best address the issue. Positive behavioral support is dedicated to cultivating partnerships in the problem-solving process. 



EXERCISE:  SUPPORTS

Complete the communication chart for yourself

Directions: 

1. Think about how you express yourself when you are extremely angry.  Do you scream? Do you shut down? What about when you are annoyed?  How do people know? Use the second column to write two or three of these behaviors.  
2. Next fill in the third column of the chart.  What emotion or , feelings do each of the behaviors express?  Write the corresponding meaning next to the behavior with which it is associated.
3. Complete the first column by describing what causes you to express each of the specific behaviors. 
4. Finish the chart by identifying the behaviors others need to exhibit that would support you in positive ways through the experience.
5. Reconnect with your partner and share each of your Communication Charts.
6. Have a conversation that will help your partner identify what constitutes positive support for them.  

* What does good support look like? 
* What do others need to know and do to foster good support? 
* What is important to the quality of the person's life? What needs to be 
present that helps the person to have a good day? How about a really great day?


* What is important for the person to have? Are there things that the person must take care of regarding health and safety? What about peace of mind?  

7. When you are done with the conversation, transfer what you have identified for yourself into the SUPPORT section of your own Framework template. Feel free to include information that did not come up in the conversation if it is important to know about supporting you.

COMMUNITY CONNECTEDNESS

Living a good life depends largely upon the degree to which our capacities, abilities and gifts are acknowledged, valued and find reciprocal relationships with others.  Real strength in communities lies in its ability to recognize and utilize the abilities and gifts of all of its members.

Communities that are weak or failing almost always have at their core one eye on the deficiencies of a person and the other eye on fixing the problem.  This view is not useful in building communities because it sees people as potential clients or consumers.  Powerful communities must have people who are citizens and producers, (McKnight, 1993).

The experience of community happens when its citizens find a welcomed and valued place in the world.  Finding that place relies on the exploration, discovery and utilization of individual capacity.  
 
People who have had to live on the margins of community may have difficulty surfacing or believing in their undiscovered giftedness.  They may be at a loss about where to use their gifts and talents or how to find others who share them.  That is where the Framework for Planning and other person-centered tools can be very helpful.  

The unique talents, gifts and capacities that are revealed about a person serve as the focal point for thinking about making connections to the community.  A review of the talents, gifts and capacities leads toward answering the question What are the potential roles that a person who possesses these talents and skills, gifts and capacities might hold?  A list of potential roles can be developed with the individual and the person may identify which, if any of the roles might appeal to them.  

When a person has a clearer sense of what their personal target is, as with identifying the citizenship roles one might like to experience, finding the places within the local community that support the role(s) provides the direction for making connections.  What places might value the contributions of the targeted role?  Where are such places located? What about places that utilize some pieces represented in the role? What is the "hidden" capacity of any community; the places that exist past what is obvious but are equally relevant?

Every local community always has a great number of potentially hospitable places where the people share their individual contributions.  The strongest community understands that it needs the gifts and contributions of every single member in order to thrive.  The Framework for Planning is one tool to help cultivate the pathway that leads people with disabilities to their rightful place in our society as full citizens.  


It's not our differences that divide us.  It's our judgments about each other that do.    ~ Margaret Wheatley
