Working Effectively with People with Learning Disabilities


What is a Learning Disability?

The National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities 
describes the term "learning disability" as a general term 
referring to a heterogeneous group of disorders 
manifested by significant difficulties in the acquisition 
and use of listening, spelling, reading, writing, reasoning, 
or mathematical skills. These disorders are intrinsic to 
the individual, presumed to be caused by central 
nervous system dysfunction, and they exist throughout 
the person's life. A learning disability is not a disorder 
that an individual "grows out of."  It is a permanent 
disorder that has a significant effect on learning but is 
not an indicator of intelligence.  An individual with a 
learning disability may develop compensatory skills that 
help them to overcome the disability.

Problems in self-regulatory behaviors, social 
perceptions, and social integration may exist with 
learning disabilities but do not, by themselves, constitute 
learning disabilities. Although learning disabilities may 
occur concomitantly with other disabilities, they are not 
the result of those conditions or influences.

Learning disabilities affect some 10% of the American 
workforce.  As a result, many persons applying for 
work or currently employed by an employer will have 
learning disabilities.  These individuals are often 
intelligent, creative and productive.

Learning disabilities can sometimes cause inconsistent 
work performance and may require reasonable 
accommodation.  Some learning disabilities may have a 
global effect on functioning in the workplace.  Other 
individuals may only need a reasonable accommodation 
for a specific task.

Some common learning disability terminology is listed 
below:

Dyslexia - difficulty with language processing, which, 
in turn, affects reading, writing, and spelling.

Dyspraxia - difficulty with fine motor skills and 
coordination.

Dysgraphia - difficulty with writing, spelling, and 
writing composition.

Auditory Discrimination - difficulty in perceiving 
differences between speech sounds and sequencing 
these sounds into meaningful words, which affects 
reading and spoken language.

Visual Discrimination - difficulty in noticing important 
details and assigning meaning to what is seen, which is 
critical to reading and writing.

What is the Impact of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act on People with Learning 
Disabilities?

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits 
discrimination against people with disabilities.  The term 
disability under the ADA is defined as:
1)	a physical or mental impairment that substantially 
limits one or more of the major life activities of such 
individual, 
2)	a record of such an impairment or, 
3)	being regarded as having such an impairment.  

"Substantially limits" means that the person is unable to 
perform, or significantly limited in the ability to perform, 
an activity as compared with an average person in the 
general population.  "Major life activities" refers to 
functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual 
tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, 
learning, and working. 

Learning disabilities are considered physical or mental 
impairments.  The term "Specific Learning Disabilities" 
is cited in the regulations of the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which enforces the 
ADA, implementing the employment provisions of the 
ADA (29 C.F.R. Part 1630).  

Whether the ADA would protect a person with a 
learning disability from discrimination depends on 
whether the disability substantially limits a major life 
activity.  For example, an employee whose auditory 
perception difficulties causes her to be unable to gain 
information from a staff meeting likely would have an 
ADA disability, especially where most employees 
would have little or no difficulty gaining relevant 
information from the meeting.  By contrast, the inability 
to take excellent notes of a highly detailed, eight-hour 
technical discussion would not constitute a substantial 
impairment because the average person would also not 
be able to do this.

As the definition of disability makes plain, an employer 
also may not discriminate against an individual with a 
record of a disability or against someone perceived as 
being disabled.  For example, job applicants who have 
been through special education may not be 
discriminated against based on a school record of a 
disability.  Similarly, employers also may not 
discriminate against applicants with learning disabilities 
because of a perception or fear that they cannot read.

An individual's limitations must be caused by a learning 
disability. Thus, an employee who is unable to read or 
write because he or she was never taught these skills, 
and not because of a learning disability, would not be an 
individual with a disability under the ADA.  

Causes of Learning Disabilities.

A learning disability is a developmental disorder that is 
present from birth, although it may go undetected until 
later in life.  While genetic predisposition, perinatal 
injury, and various neurological or other medical 
conditions may be associated with the development of 
learning disabilities, the presence of such conditions 
does not invariably predict an eventual learning 
disability. 

Some individuals with learning disabilities have no 
familial, medical, or environmental history that would 
predict a learning disorder.

Potential Functional Limitations Caused 
by Learning Disabilities.

Workers with learning disabilities may have difficulties 
with:

*  Processing auditory material (e.g. receiving oral 
directions and other communication issues)
*  Writing, including:  issues with spelling, grammar, 
and/or sentence structure; expressing information in 
a written format; and/or legible handwriting.
*  Reasoning ability regarding the comprehension of 
new information, quantitative information, or 
complex verbal information.
*  Reading speed or reading comprehension.

Workplace Accommodations for 
Individuals with Learning Disabilities.

Reasonable accommodations are by definition 
individualized in order to meet the needs of the specific 
applicant or employee.  Some accommodations may 
include:

*  Alternate print formats
*  Reduced-distraction work environments
*  Computer technology for written work
*  Reading materials presented in auditory formats
*  Extended time to learn job tasks or to perform 
work
*  Instructions presented both in written and oral 
formats
*  Allowing the employee to tape-record important 
information
*  Clearly defined job requirements, including the 
dates when projects assignments are due; advance 
notice of any changes
*  Providing handouts and visual aids
*  Using more than one way to demonstrate or explain 
information
*  Breaking information into small steps when teaching 
many new tasks in one lesson (state objectives, 
review previous lesson, summarize periodically)
*  Allowing time for clarification of directions and 
essential information
*  Providing assistance with the proofreading of 
written work
*  Allowing the use of spell check and grammar-
assistive devices

When in doubt about possible accommodations, ask 
the employee what would be helpful.  In addition, 
remember to observe confidentiality.  For example, 
avoid pointing out the employee or the alternative 
arrangements to the rest of the work group.
