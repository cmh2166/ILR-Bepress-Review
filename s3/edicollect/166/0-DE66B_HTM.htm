<div class=Section2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The United States Bureau of the
Census provides the official poverty rate of various sub-populations in the United States, but does not do so for working-age people with disabilities.  Figure 1 shows
the levels and trends in the poverty rate of working-age people (aged 21-64)
with and without disabilities using the official United States Bureau of Census
measure of poverty from 1979-2004.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The data used in Figure 1 is from
the 2004 and earlier Current Population Surveys (CPS).   We use the CPS work limitation–based
measure to define the working age population with disabilities.<a href="#_edn1"
name="_ednref1" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>
(See: Stapleton and Burkhauser 2003 for a fuller discussion of the reliability
of this measure and its uses.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Figure 1 shows that over the
business cycle of the 1980s (1979-1989), the poverty rate of both those with
and those without disabilities rose as the country moved from a business cycle
peak in 1979 to a business cycle trough in 1983.  Between 1983 and 1989 the United States economy experienced six years of economic growth, but the rewards of that
growth did not fully reach the lowest levels of the income distribution. While
the poverty rate of both working-age people with and without disabilities fell
between 1983 and 1989, both had a higher poverty rate in 1989 than in 1979.  Furthermore,
the risk of poverty of those with disabilities relative to those without
disabilities rose from 3.18 to 3.48.  That is, working-age people with
disabilities were 3.18 times more likely to be in poverty than were working-age
people without disabilities in 1979. By 1989 their relative risk of poverty
grew to 3.48.  Hence, over the 1980s business cycle the risk of poverty grew both
for working age people with and without disabilities, but more so for those with
a disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The business cycle of the 1990s
(1989-2000) began in the same way for both working- age people with and without
disabilities. Their poverty rate grew between 1989 and 1993 as the economy once
again moved from a business cycle peak to a business cycle trough.  But over the
next seven years, the rewards of economic growth dramatically reduced the
poverty rate of working-age people without disabilities.  Their poverty rate
fell from 9.40 percent in 1993 to 6.79 percent in 2000.  Thus by the end of the
1990s business cycle their poverty rate was not only lower than their 7.83 percent
poverty rate at the start of the 1990s business cycle, but lower than their
poverty rate at the start of the 1980s business cycle.  The poverty rate of
working-age people without disabilities in the business cycle peak year of 2000
was at its lowest point over the past two business cycles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Unfortunately, this was not the
case for working-age people with disabilities.  While their poverty rate fell
from 31.28 percent in 1993 to 28.07 percent in 2000, this was still higher than
their 27.76 percent poverty rate in 1989 and considerably greater than their
21.87 percent poverty rate of 1979.  Hence over the 1990s business cycle, the
absolute risk of poverty continued to rise for those with disabilities while it
fell for those without disabilities.  Hence, by 2000, the relative risk of
poverty of those with disabilities rose to an all time high of 4.13 times that
of working-age people without disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The business cycle of the first
part of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century has only just begun. As the economy moved
from growth to recession between 2000 and 2003, the poverty rate of both working-age
people with and without disabilities once again increased and, as was the case in
the two previous recessions, the relative risk of poverty fell for those with
disabilities. It is likely that future CPS data will show that 2003 was the
trough year of our current business cycle. But how much of the rewards of economic
growth during the upswing of our current business cycle will reach the lower
end of the income distribution and especially working-age people with
disabilities remains to be seen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In our paper, (Burkhauser,
Houtenville and Rovba, 2005) we show that the overall trends reported in Figure
1 are not sensitive to changes in the composition of the population of
working-age people with disabilities.   We also show that the 1990s, while a
great period for those without disabilities, in terms of net income growth and poverty
reduction, was not so for working age people with disabilities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The remarkable rise in the absolute
and relative poverty rates of working-age people with disabilities over the
past two decades has gone almost entirely without official notice, because
unlike other sub-populations, the United States Bureau of the Census does not
officially track the employment and economic well-being of working age people
with disabilities.  Our paper offers one method of measuring the poverty rate
of working age people with disabilities. It uses the same CPS data and poverty definitions
used by the United States Bureau of the Census to measure the poverty rates of
other sub-populations. The first step in reducing the poverty of working age
people with disabilities is for the United States Bureau of the Census to begin
officially tracking the poverty rates of the working age population with
disabilities, so we are able to clearly see the dimensions of the problem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 1.</p>
<p class=msonormal>
<BR>
Figure 1 is a graph titled: Trends in Poverty Rates of Working Age People With and Without Disabilities (Aged 21-64), 1979-2003. 

The graph follows the poverty rates of people without disabilities and people with disabilities as well as the ratio of the former to the latter. Each plot has a distinct data point for each year ranging from 1979 to 2003. The poverty rate for people without disabilities rises from 6.88 in 1979 to 10.10 in 1983 where it peaks and generally trends lower with a few more peaks and troughs. Most recently the poverty rate for people without disabilities bottomed out at 6.79 in the year 2000 and has since been on a rise up to a rate of 8.02 in the year 2003. 

The poverty rate for people with disabilities rises sharply from 21.87 in 1979 to 28.61 in 1983, peaking in the same year as those without disabilities and then trends slightly lower. However, the poverty rate begins to rise again in 1989 from 27.26 to a new high in 1993 of 31.28 before falling back to previous levels and most recently ending in 2003 at a rate of 28.85

The plot of the ratio of poverty rates between people without disabilities and people with disabilities actually experiences a sharp decline from 1979 to 1982, from 3.18 to 2.75; bottoming out around the time that both poverty rates are peaking. The ratio rises from 2.83 in 1983 to 3.49 in 1990 before experiencing a sudden drop to 3.17 the next year. From 1992 onward, the ratio has generally trended higher reaching its highest point in the year 2000 at 4.13. In 2003, the ratio has dropped back to 3.6.
