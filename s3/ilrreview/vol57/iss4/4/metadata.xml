<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Using a unique dataset based on individual Unemployment Insurance wage records for Illinois in the 1990s that are matched to other Census data, the authors analyze the extent to which escape from or entry into low earnings among adult workers was associated with changes in their employers and firm characteristics. The results show considerable mobility into and out of low earnings status, even for adults. They indicate that job changes were an important part of the process by which workers escaped or entered low-wage status, and that changes in employer characteristics help to account for these job changes. Matches between personal and firm characteristics also contributed to observed earnings outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

<value>This document reports the results of research and analysis undertaken by the U.S. Census Bureau staff.  It has undergone a Census Bureau review more limited in scope than that given to official Census Bureau publications, and its release is intended both to inform interested parties of ongoing research and to encourage discussion of work in progress.  This research is a part of the U.S. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program (LEHD), which is partially supported by the National Science Foundation Grant SES–9978093 to Cornell University (Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research), the National Institute on Aging, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
The research was also funded by grants from the Russell Sage and Rockefeller Foundations and the Employment and Training Administration.  The authors thank Henry Jackson and George Putnam of the Illinois Department of Employment Security for their helpful comments.</value>
